Teresa A. Braggs,"Queer-ness is steadily and unfortunately gaining popular ‘awareness’ and acceptance, especially in the Indian digital public sphere. With a new wave of LGBTQIA++++++++ social media activists and personalities setting a standard and expectation for what the average, English speaking Indian queer person must look like and talk like and eat like and consume like — I, as someone whose sexual identity is largely expressed by who and how I want to fuck, find myself having to search too hard for the sex in sexuality. This social moment of having to intellectualise and sanitise the queer sex out of queer sexuality to be palatable to the heterosexual/closeted/missionary eye is something that really turns me off, so to speak. 

My proposal for this project is intended to be an audio/visual exploration/study of sex (fucking), in (and hopefully moving away from) the discourse and rhetoric of sexuality — specifically queer sexuality. Grounded in my practice of experimental photography/filmmaking, sound essays, digital collages, and poetry — this project aims to document and express the experience of fucking, for fucking, by fucking (we’ll see about this one) — and maybe, by effect but without deliberation, punctuate the language of gender and sexual expression with what comes of it — even if briefly. ",This documentary will trace sexual encounters and experiences of participants (mostly queer-identified friends and lovers) who actively (even if begrudgingly) seek and find sex and avenues for erotic gratification on the internet (via social media/niche websites/dating apps). The language that these participants use to navigate their erotics In the digital space is something I am keenly interested in. My personal experiences with bringing sex and sexuality off the digital and into the physical is something that will also populate the final film exhibited. ,"Research, direction, camera work, sound recording, graphic design —  standard 70+ hrs for project scale.

That is, to root sexuality and gender back to the body and the physical — without taking on the burden of sanitising it for heterosexual sensibilities. For example, I identify a part of the problem as language such as ’approaching the themes and questions of gender’. An answer to “as opposed to what??”, however, if you wonder, is what the project hopes to show (not tell).","Teresa has worked with the media of found text,  documentary sound, visuals, and the moving image in prior artistic work.

#MalashriHeladMeleAshte #IamMalashri #MalashriGeBekuJustice #MalashriBoss

To reclaim the Gender Bending career of Kannada superstar actress Malashri (filmography 1989 – present) into the Trans Feminist narrative through the popular medium of TikTok* (TikTok is used as a placeholder, clarified later in the application). Similar to how Rajinikanth/Chuck Norris have become meme-kings for a brand of logic defying masculinity based entirely on their on-screen personas, can we similarly reclaim the gender bending onscreen career of Kannada superstar Malashri? Can Malashri become a meme/figurehead for entertaining, hilarious, theatrical transfeminism in a popular, commercial language on social media platform of TikTok*? 

I propose a social experiment where:
-        20 collaborators who defy gender (they can be cis gendered feminists, transpeople or non-binary) will take part. 
-        Participants will be from a range of gender identities, economic backgrounds, social media presence and geographical locations (urban, rural and subaltern Karnataka). 
-        They are invited to create 1 minute TikTok* videos using popular TikTok techniques - meme, dub smash, transition, voice over, laugh track etc. 
-        The videos can be as different from each other as possible, but what unites them will be: Reclaiming Malashri’s filmography to bring a hilarious, provocative, engaging new voice to the trans-feminist narrative. 
-        These videos will be collated and released with the hashtag: #MalashriChallenge, #MalashriHelidaMeleAshte #IamMalashri (and other such hastags) on TikTok*

Will this hastag become viral? Can we create an icon for trans-feminism who is not English-speaking, artsy or alternative? Can trans-feminism find a language within the popular mainstream cultural language, but yet challenge the culture’s misogyny? To accomplish this feat, I would place my bets on the ultimate Gender Bender of Kannada cinema, Kanasina Rani (Queen of Dreams) Malashri! 

WHY MALASHRI
Growing up in the late 80’s and 90’s, for me and several others who felt trapped in Kannada’s gendered landscape, Malashri’s on screen histrionics provided a breath of fresh air, rife with permission and possibilities. Malashri was no feminist icon, her characters always ultimately upheld the patriarchy, yet, she managed to turn feminine stereotypes on their head and coin a new language for the ‘modern’ heroine.

With title roles in superhits such as Policeana Hendathi (1990) Kitturina Huli (1990), Hrudaya Haadithu (1991), Belli Kaalungura (1992) Malashri was the industry’s most popular lead female actor. Her roles redefined female desire, sexuality and femininity for a whole generation of women. 

In her debut film, Nanjundi Kalyana, a misogynistic retelling of ‘taming of the shrew’, Malashri holds her own – when the Hero ‘tames’ her by subjecting the wealthy, modern Malashri to the hard village life of cold showers, ragi mudde (millet) meals, farm labour and a thatched hut - she defies him by getting drunk in a local village arrack shop, gyrating in super hit song ‘Nashe yeride, jopana’ (I am intoxicated, be careful). To this day, this song is a part of every Kannada girl’s house party playlist, celebrating the idea that a drunk woman is a ‘danger to a man’, and not vice versa.

Malashri entered Kannada films in 1989 and by 1992, she had starred as the lead in 19 movies - all of which were superhits. With this, she surpassed the legendary Rajkumar’s 24-year-old record of highest releases in lead roles in Kannada in a single year (Rajkumar had 16 releases in 1968). 

Her comic timing, drama and emotional range were matched by her dancing skills and fight sequences. Malashri was unlike any heroine the Kannada cinema has seen. Let me illustrate this point by copy pasting wikipedia synopsis of her superhit film ‘Malashree Mamashree’ (1992): “A man goes against his father's wish and gets married to the woman he loves, Malashree. However, when his father tries to separate them, Malashree decides to teach him a lesson”. 

In the late 90’s Malashri took a hiatus and in 2000, Malashri, returned to the silver screen in a brand new quasi-masculine avatar. Sporting short hair, oversized shirt with leather straps, she starred in a slew of superhit films where she takes on the ‘system’. Chamundi (2000), Durgi, Kannadada Kiran Bedi (2009), Shakti (2012), Veera (2013) and Ganga (2015). 
The transformation of an ultra-feminine Malashri into a masculine-heroine was no shock for the public – they responded to her new avatar with similar fervor. At the age of 45, Malashri, played the leading heroine with a macho masculinity that Kannada cinema had never seen before – coming full circle as the ultimate Gender Bender, making her filmography the ideal vehicle to initiate popular, engaging dialogue on female desire, sexuality and trans-feminism","A feminist reclamation cannot ignore public discourse. Since Malashri is the face of this reclamation, the choice of TikTok mirrors the milieu in which she is rooted. 

-        TikTok viewership mirrors Malashri’s fan following- from IT crowd to sex workers, from housewives to trans people, vegetable vendors, cab drivers and city dwellers are TikTok users. 
-        TikTok popularity reaches far, wide and deep into Karnataka, much more than social media platforms like Instagram or Twitter which are largely urban, English language dominant and ‘woke’.

Since most trans feminist discourse stays in the alternative, artsy space, TikTok becomes an important vehicle to reach the large, mainstream Kannada public not just as viewers/consumers but as active participants who can freely respond to the challenge of subverting the filmography of a commercial mainstream icon like Malashri. 

In the absence of TikTok (banned in India from June 2020 over national security issues) the void has been replaced by 3 major apps that all have over 100 million plus users: 
-        MX Takatak
-        Moj
-        Josh 

All three of them mimic TikTok and have co-opted its huge Kannada and regional language content as well as its language, format and aesthetics. Kannada content on these platforms have several thousand plus followers. 

Initial research shows us that there are some popular Malashri-based videos which includes songs, fight sequences and lip synced dialogues. Therefore, the scope for the #MalashriChallenge is high. 

The hashtags we use have to be carefully chosen since each app has its own set of viral hashtags. To become viral, a hashtag should ideally be a Kannada phrase that can be used in both English text and Kannada text to make sure it reaches all types of users. Therefore, #MalashriChallenge works! 

 Enabled by the grant, I will be able to: 
-        Hire a social media researcher who can advise on how to create a viral hashtag. 
-        Create a document on the various TikTok techniques. This along with Malashri’s filmography with YouTube links will aid the 15 collaborators to create content. 
-        Hire an animator/designer conversant with TikTok aesthetics to create 5 #MalashriChallenge memes which will help to start the challenge. 
-        Therefore, 5 memes + 15 collaborator videos = 20 videos, makes a good start for a viral hashtag. 

Example of what I imagine the 5 memes I intend to create will look like:  
Footage from RaniMaharani where Malashri gets her evil step-parents in line with a hunter (whip) with the iconic dialogue ‘Do you understand?’ Hence the meme ‘I will wear what I want, do you understand’ is rife with trans-feminist possibilities. #MalashriChallenge #MalashiHelidaMeleAshte #DoYouUnderstand
Footage from Kitturina Huli where Malashri screams ‘There is no justice, there is no justice’ in a courtroom with the blinded justice symbol. Memes such as “No Beef biryani in your house? There is no justice” OR “Same sex marriage is not allowed in India anthe (it seems)! There is no justice” #Malashri Challenge #GiveUsJustice #MalashiHelidaMeleAshte ","1.

I write, act, direct and collaborate with a range of forms, communities and theatre makers across local, national and international locations. My work is often research based, collaborative and exploratory. I am interested in the gaps between binaries such as Man-Woman, Urban-Rural, Traditional-Modern, Kannada-English and my work thrives in these in-between spaces. I am one of the founders of Bangalore based theatre collective Dramanon, Bengaluru established in 2008, which produces new writing, nurtures emerging voices and engages with corporate workplaces in furthering Diversity, Equity and inclusive practices. 

I am an INLAKS scholar and a Member of the Lincoln Center Director’s Lab, New York.
","TESTIMONIALS FROM COLLABORATORS I CALLED FOR #MALASHRICHALLENGE: 

Kruti Purapemane, a cis gendered Kannada feminist, scholar and farmer in Heggodu says: “Malashri made so many things okay, who cares if she upheld patriarchy! She showed me that being a ‘ganduberi’ (tomboy), outspoken and modern were not crimes – we drink village arrack and romance men, overdo our lipsticks and speak our minds and yet, we would find doting male lovers and have happy marriages. Malashri taught me how to dance with patriarchy, she gave me hope that I could live in a man’s world with a degree of selfhood and freedom”. 

Veena Shivalingiah, a Dalit transwoman activist and actor in my play Nava says “Both me and my partner, Preetam, who is a transman – we adore Malashri. Preetam is like her in Belli modagalu – he will do anything for love, he is a tomboy but he’s soft inside. But I am like Malashri in Kannadada Kiran Bedi (laughs). I am a big rowdy you know (laughs). A Malashri film puts us back on our feet”. 

Rumi Harish, human rights activist Hindustani singer who identifies as non-binary, says “Who is there as a transmasculine icon in Kannada mainstream apart from Malashri? Have you seen Durgi, our very own B Jayshree is also in it! You’re wasting your life if you haven’t seen it… She is in this ultra-macho avatar, but she redefines masculinity in every frame. Any project you are doing on Malashri, count me in”","I am currently working on an Arts Research Grant 2021 funded by the India Foundation for the Arts (IFA), the research topic being “THE NEGOTIATIONS OF FEMALE PERFORMING BODY WITH SEXUALITY, PATRIARCHY AND VULGARITY IN KANNADA COMPANY THEATRE (1960- PRESENT)”. My research explores the ‘crudely’ comical embodied by actresses as a source of patriarchal discomfort and examines female attention-drawing in public as a form of rebellion within a patriarchy. 

My latest works include Akshayambara (2015-present), an experimental Kannada play which critically examines gender, power and masculinity in Yakshagana with a contemporary feminist lens. Akshayambara imagines a reversal of roles in the popular Yakshagana plot of Draupadi Vastrapaharana (disrobing of Draupadi). The play has performed over 150 shows across theaters in Karnataka to National festivals from NSD Delhi to ITFoK Kerala, South Bank Center UK and Kala Utsavam Singapore, to critical acclaim. 

Nava (2019 –present) is a Kannada play in collaboration with 9 transgender women from Aravani Art Project. Nava is a retelling of the navarasa through the marginalized voices and bodies of 9 transwomen. The play premiered at the Ranga Shankara Festival 2019 and was on a tour of Karnataka’s state theatres and was invited to Serendipity Festival 2020, when the pandemic hit us. 

I am Not Here (2018-present) a devised dance-theatre exploration of female censorship in collaboration with Bangalore based director Deepika Arwind and contemporary dancer Ronita Mookerji. The play has performed at TATALitLive, NCPA, Mumbai 2019, Prithvi Theatre, NSD Festival Delhi and the Singapore Fringe Festival 2020.

Dheeraj Kumar,"MAUGA - born in a small village in Bihar much before phones with camera and social media. he could remember there were no electricity in his village and men use to hang out in circles either playing cards or cracking male jokes with each other. Male jokes, bcz. he couldn't understand those double meaning indirect dirty, lame jokes which always had sex or something related to women, he found them gross. 
he clearly remembers, with everyone else touching each other, holding each others hands, two guys being too close was normal but he used to feel uncomfortable and always found himself out of space. why? bcz the way male members around him use to treat him differently. very few elderly people would consider him normal and not make fun. rest, everyone else he found the same. one afternoon he came back home crying and asked him mother they all tease him by calling him names. what does MAUGA means? 
mom said- this should not affect you. instead, you can also give them names. 
the Term MAUGA they use for feminine guys in his village - Dumariya.
Mauga means a man who is feminine, and enjoys company of females more than that of males, especially during social gatherings. So when all males are sitting at one place and all females are sitting at other, Mauga will be the odd one out sitting with females chatting and gossiping, referred to people acting effeminate. So basically it denotes any male who is not physically strong enough, who is shy, whose voice is not coarse or rough, one who can not defend himself. mauga word for a male who has is lewd and lustful and shows such character openly which people think is indecent

It was a different kind of childhood, where he felt like- how they all knew it. was he so  obvious? No, it took him many years to understand himself, his body, his feelings. 
while growing up he also never found anyone around him, who was same like him. maybe this would have given him a different kind of comfort or boosted his confidence. he accepted himself as a different child with some kind of disability. 

He recalls, one striking incident where during one of the neighbours wedding celebrations. the Sound of – CHECK CHECK  CHECK, MIKE TESTING 1 2 3 could not stop his curiosity of going to see what was Happening there?  in between crowded circle of men all over he managed to make some space and when he reaches the front, he could see a Beautiful lady like- fully dressed up with make up, wearing beautiful clothes and so confidently Dancing with so much of energy got him smile on his face. while he also started enjoying the dance show, he also noticed few rude men passing dirty comments on the Dancer, to which he either gave a Gorgeous teasing smile in return or responded back in a vulgour manner. other men started laughing at the person for passing such comment on her/him, this he found very impowering. That’s where the introduction of NACHANIYA happened in his life.

he was so much fond of them that day, he says - whole afternoon he was hanging out there bcz of his curiosity towards them. he wanted to know more and more. after the performances, they would go back to a common room which was all covered and close from all the sides. still, there were few kids hanging out on the windows to peep inside. he tried to do so too. He was so amused to see them how they carry it sophistically, with grace, lady like Body language, while they were playing with their Duppata or always making sure if the Bindi on the foreheads or the ear rings were on right place. 
Now these visuals flashbacks to his memory every time when he is Preparing someone for the shoot. it has became his lifestyle now, whenever he meets someone like him, he asks if he can do pictures with them and once they agree, he jumps with excitement. 
This childlike behaviour of him, some beautiful memories he is grateful in his life even though he says His childhood was very different from the rest of the kids, it was not so easy.
This took him years to know himself, which they all knew already. 

","The limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. most of us are born especial as a kid, we all have some kind of unique qualities.  Since i got independent with a job and a place of my own far far away from the past village . i started doing this project dont remember when. This Project of Using different kinds of masks to cover the faces, hide the identities of individuals and style them with different accessories giving them a look where the person is so bold, confident, stylish as well as powerful, gives me an impression maybe bcz. the faces are always covered that's why they are able to pose with so much of comfort. yes, its true. many times i have also met model looking beautiful boys and i did portraits of them. there is a obvious Effort to show that these are male bodies into these characters behind. Trust me it goes to an extent  where the self of person changes in between the process and that's why sometimes they start enjoying it so much that i don't need to give much of directions to them.

These artworks brings a sense of freedom, comfort, beauty and  start a conversation related to many issues - Child psychology, how to educate parents about their own child. what i felt as a child, i don't encourage the same behaviour to other kids. it hurts me so much, when i see a similar child struggling with the same issue. 

now we are in the world where every kid is more aware with their cell phones with Tiktok in them. Dont know if its part of fun or just the idea of self coming out, when i see most of the Boys dressed up as Girls. so we are now where we can change the perspective of people how they think about us. The future generation can be educated and made aware of how to be polite, kind to others and treat everyone equally. 

As a photographer in this project  I would like to explore the various parts of the story by adding people of all the age groups in it.
going on with the similar direction where the faces are covered with masks and Bodies are shown, it would be interesting to see how the image of a young boy or a very old man looks like with different skin in it. also, people of different Body sizes and color would be interesting to add Which can expand the Horizon of Binary system.
Continuing the theme around – sexuality and social Norms. I would like to present a series of Portraits where the Background also focuses as a additional story to the characters. Keeping the identities Anonymous, opens up the Horizon as comfort is the focus in these artworks. i would also like to try open space as background than just plain while backgrounds here. this could be either shoot on real set or collage work done into the artworks afterwards. 

At the end of the project, I would like to showcase a set of finished artworks or a collage of mixed things explored during the process. Which can be presented as a COFFEE TABLE BOOK, or calendars or simply beautiful strong imaginaries.","Keeping in mind  a set of 10 -12 different artworks focusing on the looks of NACHANIYA in them. i am proposing a budget of 75,000 here - 
MODELS  – 10 -12 would be around 2k each comes up to 20k. I would like to pay the participating models/ subject for their time and efforts. 
MASKS – creating a set of 10 – 12 (10 x 2 k = 20 k)  masks with detailed features of Nachaniya in them. 
PROPS - Renting Accessories for styling purposes - 10 x 1k = 10k. I would like to use accessories which can be commonly used for all the other models too. Basically they all have a similar set of looks.
FINAL OUTCOME - creating collages with additional colors, print outs, textures – 
10 x 2.5k = 25 k 

TOTAL - ( 20 K +20 K + 10 K + 25 K = 75 K ) 
","Dheeraj kumar, born 26th Aug 1991, Hails from Bihar and is a trained fashion designer turned photographer, artist.
He has travelled in various states of south India, while simultaneously learning and practicing the craft of photography. He is inspired by personalities like – FRIDA KAHLO, ROBERT MAPPLETHROPE AND HENRY MOORE. Aspired to define with his lenses, his personal approach towards – life, beauty and art.
He travels to sleepy villages of southern India to capture the moods, emotions, culture, traditions, colors that drew him to this part of India to most. He takes inspirations from around what he sees and tries to add these experiences as a part of Detail to his artworks. Masks and Rangolis made outside every house in streets of south India is something very common and obvious represented throughout his works. 
Its an expression where artist takes headless, anonymous bodies and puts them in different backgrounds adding nature details in it to give it a complete different meaning to them. you can find lots of Nature inspirations in his works right from flowers to birds to different expressions of Humans in it. Anonymous Male bodies has been always a medium to express through his art. Mixing Headless male Naked bodies with elements of flora and fauna in his works can be clearly seen throughout his works. 

“THE HUMAN FORM WITH ITS MANY COMPLEXITIES AND LAYERS IS ANOTHER QUEST AND A CONSTANT SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR ME”
He currently divides his time between Bangalore and Pondicherry.
","As a part of my Practice - Human Body, Gender, sexuality, society norms are common topics i have been taking inspirations from and add these experiences in my works. when you look at all of my works since beginning the struggle of the child from the village in Dumariya is clearly seen into the works. how a child with his curiosity looks at everything and he also holds to things which he likes. 
This project Talks about sexuality, comfort, compassion of relationship. Creating artworks which provokes emotions, asks questions. as an Artist here i am  playing as well as  exploring his artistic and sexual individuality through a play on cultural norms,  blatant sexuality, gay rights and mainstream social stigma. This project examines how contemporary art contributes to the frictional negotiations of identities, communities, histories and artistic tradition or trajectory. Body, gender, sexuality, Self acceptance, comfort- Dressing up, online – tik tok culture, self exploration. Being behind mask gives another dimension to anonymity.
Nachaniya itself as a subject breaks all the norms. Remembering them performing during the childhood days also had lot of questions left in the artists mind and while now he works on it, he doesn’t only solves those questions but also asks more questions of gender as a part of his expression. beginning to working with regular non models MALE individuals, covering their faces with masks, adding elements to style them in a proper manner to give a complete different transformation as a FEMALE outcome completely justifies the theme and questions of Gender. ","The artist, who is a trained fashion designer, employs the craft of photography, to study the body not just as the wearer but also as the vessel and a canvas. He attempts to voice his undiluted opinion of the human form and what it means- removed from societal conditioning. With his works he also endeavours to reconcile with his traditions, and imbue them with his own vibrant experiences. Flowers can be seen as a continuous element as a decorative detail into the artworks. Holi body series is a set of detailed Body part images with pigments on them, brings a sense of joy and freedom to the viewers. 
Body vases - a series of Headless human bodies in different abstract forms giving a shape of flower vase, is an interesting concept too where artist plays with dry flowers put together into these vases.
started with portraits of beautiful south Indian men, he started masks as a concept for his projects. masks and Rangolis made outside the houses in south India inspires him in everyday life. Artist is very much inspired by Frida kahlo, Mapplethorpe and Henry Moore. 
A set of Black n white male body series are also one of the strong works from the past. 
Not only creating artworks but also artist believes that his artworks can evoke emotions at the viewers and create a sense of Belonginess, attachment to them. with the Project MAUGA, artist wants to create a series of imaginaries which everyone can relate to themselves. adding masks on the faces creates a sense of anonymity. keeping the models anonymous into the project the artist wants to start conversations of gender related issues in the society.

Li Actuallee (Lisha Kirpalani),"Examining European landscape painting and cartography, as well as questioning the lineage of botany and natural history drawing as inherently colonial; my work finds post-colonial modes of expression informed by South Asian aesthetic traditions of flattening the foreground in order to uncover systems and networks at play. 

Over the last year I discovered Octavia E. Butler’s science fiction writings, which has heavily influenced how I relate to the world, however uncomfortable and jarring her work can be, I find reassurance in strong female protagonists and their stories. Subsequently, the work of Adrienne Maree Brown, and how she correlates Butler’s dystopias to activism and grassroots movements inspires me to do the creative work of imagining future visions. 

Issues of climate change are so large and ungraspable, that most people feel a deep sense of apathy towards these issues, no thanks to the corporate agenda the responsibility has fallen on individual agents of change. As Margret Salamon indicates it is collective action and awareness that will bring us further. Instead of shame and guilt, approaching this topic with softness and empathy will yield better solutions.

Unlike the cautionary tales of Octavia Butler, I approach my imagined universes with more hopefulness as I create explorations of my personal healing in relation to land trauma, translating this journey for collective healing. I explore boundaries and the breaking of divisions, as fluid strokes and abstract patterns occupy the conceptualized dystopian landscape, informed by contemporary life and the unseen worlds that keep the city afloat. I want to create work that feels accessible, and allows people to live in the “what if” of a better future, without a vision for a better world, what are we striving for? 

""Transform yourself to transform the world"" - Grace Lee Boggs

Reading the prompt for the Gender Bender call for proposals immediately sparked my intrigue, as the themes of gender and interactivity reside prominently in my practice. Much like many artists who came before me, I utilize concepts of “queering” in studio, and outside to explore the vast landscapes of my surroundings, as well as the human condition, and psyche. 

As a recent recipient of the BeFantastic Fellowship, 2021, as well as my post-graduate study with Professor Boris Cuckovic Berger, I have a new found confidence and hope in new media art and how it can serve future imaginings. Although I still approach the tech sector with a dose of skepticism, the cynicism comes from understanding why certain tools are created and popularized, whether the technology is created with empathy in mind, and whether human wellbeing is considered rather than just corporate profit. Researching how artists have used technology through the ages, from photography to NFTs has given me a deep appreciation for its potential. As I question the ethics of softwares, I also find a sense of play and discovery in the process. 


","Employing my existing practice, given the financial means that this proposal offers, I would be able to expand my explorations to more mediums translating two-dimensional concepts using technology, including collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI), and creating immersive virtual augmented realities (AR). Through multiple iterations of analogue and digital transcriptions, I can more deeply ponder the conundrum of how technology can help navigate creativity and issues of climate change. Although I still have a long way to go with exploring the digital realm as a means of art making, I believe I can find my authentic voice through this medium. 

The predominant methodology I foresee in this process is repetition and reinterpretation. Using physical means of drawing, painting, and printmaking, and digital tools such as ArtBreeder, GauGan, Spark AR, and p5js, to create new boundless techniques in my own unique perspective.

I am concerned with navigating themes of intimacy, identity and ecology by exploring existing patterns of the world around me. Through subdued colors and descriptive lines, my imaginary universes are equally filled with spontaneity and intricacies.

Seeped in a meditative practice, the works are modes of regeneration for both the viewer and myself, my process allows me to tackle my identity on my own terms, while simultaneously giving me permission to escape from the weight and confines of these labels. The obsessive repetition of patterns facilitates redefinition and rediscovery of the same form. In addition to mixed media drawings and paintings, my strive toward interdisciplinary practices compels me to dabble in sculpture, performance, video, and more recently animation and augmented reality. Informed by art practices of artists like Louise Bourgeois, Yayoi Kusama, and Julie Mehretu, I strive to display my work in galleries and public spaces via installations and murals.
","Deconstructing western dualism, and in turn binary ways of thinking are at the center of my practice, trying to provoke the viewer into questioning the internalized division between nature and human. This dualistic perception, where nature is feminine and culture is masculine, runs philosophically parallel to the construction of the gender binary; mistreatment of land and ecologies is concurrent with gender-based violence, homophobia, and other forms of oppression. How we treat and label the world around us, our ecologies, is very telling to the segregation and systemic oppression of marginalized people. This is the mode of cultural production my life and work try to break apart, longing for a porosity in thought and disciplines.

Johny Sajan,"The Garment Gamble (tentative title) is a project arising from a personal journey of transitioning my attires and accessories from a typical menswear to a genderfluid, gender-neutral fashion, which is based on another personal agenda of asserting my queerness. And thus, this is a very personal narrative which has the intersections of gender, sexuality, acceptance and of course queerphobia.
Historically, being queer has a deep connection with how one presents themselves, especially breaking the gender stereotypes in the clothing. Loud colors, out-of-the-box silhouettes and various experiments seen in queer past and present has become very influential in determining various fashion trends even. Transvestism, Drag culture, experimental Androgyny and non-experimental cross-dressing have been making significant queer assertion to counter and trigger the queerphobia. This risky self expression is very political and has many layers of struggles, but the ultimatum of this is the pure joy and fun one enjoys.
Since the extensive takeover of social media, we can see a lot of similar, stereotype breaking self expressions being published to a vast number of audiences and this has been a good chance for many to assert their politics very widely. As a queer, these representations among social media have given me enough confidence to make myself up and dress in a way I personally relate to, honouring my memories of wearing my mother’s saree whenever I had time and space then. Once I decided to transition from the boring, monotonous, typical wear a person assigned as a male at birth is supposed to wear, I’ve been getting a realistic perspective of how my identity is being targeted by the innate binary culture of the apparel industry, especially in an Indian context. We see courageous queer experiments on social media posts, we see the beauty of it, we see the joy of it, we don’t see the struggles behind it. Finding the safe space, countering the bullying and backlashes, dealing the traumas- forms a base layer of it. As a person who belongs to a middle class economy, I don’t have access to gender-neutral clothing and accessories brands, which themselves are very rare and expensive in India. To explore affordable fashion brands, I have to struggle through the setup of binary settings and the binary assertions of the products and the people who sell them. Honestly I’m not expecting the entire fashion culture to be non-binary. But I’d like to establish the mixture of euphoria and misery we undergo to express what we are. Because, we’re QUEER, and it’s just very serene to be us.
","I see this as an experimental documentary film, narrated mainly by a mix of 2D animation, real life footage of my experiences and my own voice. The envisioned visuals are very colour and mood oriented, semiotic to the stances of narrations. As a film about a queer rythm, made by a queer person, the visuals break the montony of conventional monotony of documentary. I visualise this film as an aesthetic amalgamation of art and design, analog and digital, hues and tones, which can be enjoyed digitally at the end.","Script Research : Rs.5000

But it always has deep connections to psychology, gender identity and gender expression. Patriarchy divides gender expression as just two constraints- masculinity and femininity, which are supposed to be how a male and female should be respectively, followed by the concerned gender roles. Queer breaks these norms- be it based on  gender or sexual orientation. Showcasing a person’s wish, struggles and joy of breaking the norm of how their assigned gender is supposed to present themselves either questions the existence of defining gender followed by its stereotypes, or depicts the multitude of the intersections of gender identity. Therefore a film of such documentation from a queer person’s own personal story is of very much significance and integrity as an artform and a political expression, when it comes to a project titled GENDER BENDER.","I’m a 22 year old person, who graduated less than 2 years ago.

prerit,"As a toy and game designer, I work with NGOs and edu-tech startups focused on schools and learning. While researching about various pedagogical methods to make learning accessible and inclusive, I have found that play is central to learned behaviors, socialization, and self-exploration as opposed to enforcing the desired behavior which leads to the development of resistance; play can be seen as a way to invite people to experiment with their self-image. The nature of play is nuanced and fluid similar to the notion of gender. I have grown up among all boy groups until recently when I have some female friends. I have observed men enjoy being feminine when acting out other women for amusement. Such performance can be seen as role-playing. A role play is one of the popular categories used in games where one can transform them into characters that could range from an alien non-human form to non-binary cyborgs. Physical features and body form define their persona. Fashion elements like make-up, clothing, and accessories used in these spaces are gender-bending and fluid. The player is free to choose to put on these avatars for their performance. 
 



","Approach:
In today’s time, the use of digital technologies has sped up; we are overstimulated by the constant flow of information in the form of, news and 'content’ for public consumption, resulting in anxieties, confusion, and aggression.

The approach and production for this project are not singular but try to combine different methods. The body of work is derived from the observation and behavior collected from various social media sources. Identifying markers of expression in text messages and other online communication channels. Library of emoticons and symbols and words are isolated and arranged to be used as a familiar device. Identifying my own desires that need to be addressed by retrospection and re connection to previous works. A narrative is built where the use of certain emoticons is prominent which will help in defining the setting or mechanism of expression

Expected outcome:

At this stage, the final outcome is not finalized. However, it could take several forms like an  AR filter mask, digital interactive jewelry or character, a set of images that highlight appreciation for femininity in abstract nature. I could use elements like colorful gemstones, pearls, and holographic accessories. These image(s) can be used as an interactive marker for it to become active or lively and might react to external sound.
Another outcome could also be a digital portrait of self, derived from this speculative fantasy world

Brinda Sarah Jacob,"Spiralling into Desire' is envisioned as a hybrid-documentary film on women's Desire and how it is held in the body. Bringing together authentic movement and mental health practitioner Brinda Jacob-Janvrin and filmmakers Roohi Dixit and Ziba Bhagwagar of Zero Rules, the film is set in the intersection between the arts, psychotherapy and spirituality. The practice and discipline of authentic movement, dreamwork and filmmaking are the bones and structure of this project which builds on both the creative process and the witnessing process, as it explores the question ‘how do we hold desire in our bodies’.  

The invitation is to drop our thoughts, ideas and judgements around desire and instead experience desire in our body as energy, as life-force, as arousal, an awakening

Authentic movement and dreamwork are the primary source for the content of this journey and film seems like a perfect medium with which to both document and aesthetically respond to this process.   The camera then becomes a witness in the authentic movement process and the film the necessary bridge between experience of the mover and the final witnesses  - the audience. The film in this case is both the witness and the safe container within which the final interaction would take place. 

The title 'Spiralling into Desire' itself comes from the pathway this process follows. Spirals are a constant theme of this journey and appears in the movement, the pathway of this inner process and what we visualise as the pathway of the film. Symbolically, the circle represents the feminine qualities (the being, the holding, the nurturing etc) and the line the masculine qualities (the doing, the moving ahead). The spiral is the union of these two forms, symbolic of the divine union between the masculine and the feminine qualities, within the individual. A lot of the movement generated is different forms of the spiral, and the pathway of this process itself on the human body traces a spiral starting from the lips/mouth around through the hands, feet, heart, pelvis, coming to rest at the yoni (lower lips).  

With 'Spiralling into Desire' we are interested to explore the following questions. 

1. Can we create a new language around desire that sees the sensual and intuitive body as potent entryways to access deeper and powerful aspects of the self? 
2. How do we shift our focus from the object of our desire and instead honour desire for itself? In doing so can our desire become a guide to our unique path? 
3. What does it mean for a community when Eros is equally prioritised as Logos?
4. How do we both document and aesthetically respond to the journey around desire, while keeping the movement essence unchanged? 
5. Can we find the spiral path in our story telling?
6. What are the shifts and transitions possible for both the mover and the witness through the many layers of witnessing and amount of time that has passed between the moving and the final witnessing?

Why Desire?

We live in a world where our Desire has been for so long feared, projected upon, objectified and distorted. Often the first step taken by any person/organisation/entity seeking power and control is to suppress and even crush desire, especially women's desire. As a result most of us have lost our connection to the true form of our longings and desires. 

Through  social and cultural conditioning, our erotic intelligence has been relegated in the shadow, or limited to the realm of superficial pleasure, sexuality and sensuality. As we sexualise, repress or project our erotic essence outwards, we disconnect from our innate body wisdom and disassociate from the essence of who we are. From this place we often make choices that are not in our wellbeing. These choices are often dangerous to us, while serving the Other/System/Patriarchy. 

We believe that reclaiming our Eros is a form of activism in itself. 




","Spiralling into desire is hybrid-documentary film that can be easily be screened on various online platforms. We have the following ideas around it -
1. We would like to premier the film on an online platform, making it freely available for 10 days . These days will be interspersed with talks, panel discussions and workshops by various experts around the topic of desire and female sexuality
2. We would like to repeat the 10 days of free screening 3 times a year, for which we will begin publicity 40 days before
3. We would like to apply to the online festival circuit for both film and dance
4. We would like to apply to the online galleries.
5. We will screen the film at all in person desire workshops. ","Pilot pitch for Spiralling into Desire

Zero Rules 
Roohi Dixit and Ziba Bhagwagar are award winning Indian filmmakers who have written, produced, and directed numerous films together. In 2003 they co-founded their production house Zero Rules. In keeping with the name of their production house, they explore and experiment with various genres of filmmaking and storytelling. Their debut feature documentary Scattered Windows, Connected Doors (2013) has screened at over 15 prestigious international film festivals and won several awards including best documentary at VISAFF (Vancouver, Canada). In 2016, the filmmakers released their experimental hybrid documentary Spaces Between (2016), a poetic interpretation of performance artist Nikhil Chopra’s 52-hour performance titled La Perle Noir at the Kochi Biennale. Roohi and Ziba are particularly interested in exploring the human condition within the confines of social constructs. As filmmakers, their collective philosophy leans towards resilience and hope in the face of strife. Currently, the filmmakers are in the process of editing their experimental film based on the theme of self-exploration during the lockdown.

We at Zero Rules are committed to the cause of equal representation of women in film and television, both on and off screen. We believe that by collaborating together with women artists and professionals from across genres and mediums, we can define and also celebrate the female gaze. We have been intrinsically associated with women centric collectives and organisations and most of our film projects have been created in this spirit of collaboration.

Short non-fiction – Songs of Cicadas (2019)","Spiralling into Desire is a documentary exploring how we hold desire in our bodies. In today's patriarchal world women are labelled either 'Madonna' or 'Whore' and those who do not identify as women are largely ignored.  The 'Madonna-Whore' split is a term coined by Sigmund Freud because he noticed a split in his male clients in their experience of women - women they loved and honoured and women they were sexually attracted to. Women had to choose between the good woman (wife) - innocent, holy, obedient, non sexual non sexy or the bad woman,  who doesn't submit, is sexual, woman who are discarded as trash - as unwanted, unlovable when they do not fit into the cultural notion of femininity . 

This split is everywhere and is so deep in the collective psyche. It originated with ownership of land and the need to know paternity. As we always know who the mother is but the only way of knowing who the father is controlling the woman's sexuality. 

Because of this split, each of us have lost our connection to our desire and as a collective we have lost connection with the feminine wisdom streams. The deep feminine is intrinsically linked to our direct experience and our intimacy with our body, dance, dreams poetry and art. One way to access this wisdom by dropping into our bodies, our senses and our heart and the easiest way to do this is through lovemaking, or working with desire.

When we move into the body then we can celebrate desire and arousal as an awakening and we move away from the limiting values and thoughts and constructs around gender but instead stay close to what moves us and our own longing. We are also able to track patriarchy as the water in which we don't know we are swimming in, and see it as a paradigm of values that is so intrinsically linked that we don't notice that it is a paradigm. We can begin to access what exists beyond the paradigm and move from objectifying the body to inhabiting the body, and experience the healing qualities of the erotic. A community that prioritises love, sexuality and eros is a community that moves away from violence and war. 

With Spiralling into Desire , we hope to approach the following questions/themes around gender
1. Is there a way women (and all those who do not identify as male) can be encouraged to access and honour their desire, instead of chasing after becoming the object of desire.? What does this open up for them? What is the shift then possible for the community?
2. How do we begin to heal the Madonna-Whore split? The primary wound of patriarchy. Is there a way the Madonna and Whore can come together to give a much fuller expression of femininity. 
3. How can we fully engage with and prioritise pleasure?  As pleasure is healing, pleasure resources our nervous system, pleasure heals trauma, what is possible for the community when pleasure and eros is prioritised?","My interest in actively working with the Feminine through the body arose in 2012 when during a contemporary dance class for adults that I was teaching at the time, I noticed that many of my female students seemed to be holding deep anger and pain in their bodies.  It was the same time when the gruesome and brutal gang rape of a young girl that took place in New Delhi was making headlines in India and abroad. This traumatic event and its telling in the collective had triggered our personal trauma of abuse and violence and was now being expressed in our movement practice. I was interested to collect these stories that were held in our bodies and share them as our bodily felt-sense response to what was happening around us. 

Collaborating with theatre maker Anitha Santhanam, we combined authentic movement, devised theatre and spoken word, to explore the voices and violence of patriarchy and its effect on the feminine. This was showcased in a performance titled 'Disbelieve'. One of the main questions Disbelieve explored was, ""how can women learn to hear their own voices amidst all the noise, to find inner autonomy and empowerment?"" Syrian American poet Mohja Kaif's poem 'Disbeliever' was the inspiring starting point for this performative journey. Disbelieve was performed in 2013 and 2014. At the end of a series of performances, which seemed to hold deep healing for both the performers and audience, one of the realisations I was left with was possibly the next step for true inner autonomy was in learning to reclaim our desire. 

Coincidentally  (or maybe not) in 2015, I began to consciously engage with my own personal process around desire. As I grappled with what it meant for a happily married woman with three children to take ownership of her desire and to be willing to both honour it and hold the impact of this on marriage, family and work, I noticed a greater spaciousness both within me and in the environment around me. This more expansive way of being facilitated my descent into the depths of my being. From here I began the process to retrieve my true autonomy and power, from my shadow where it had lain repressed for years and maybe even generations.  

Learning to reclaim my erotic sovergnity has been life affirming and I am interested in documenting and showcasing what I believe is a universal journey in getting to know deeper parts of ourselves.  A journey that can inspire us to take responsibility for ourselves, our bodies and our fulfilment. 

I did the first iteration of this in March 2018. Titled, 'Wish You Were Here,' this was a movement and photography installation that was created in collaboration with three other artists - an actress, a photographer and a professor of gender studies. The second iteration of this was a solo performance in Tenerife, Spain in September 2018. However, my personal and creative process has continued to grow and deepen in leaps and bounds beyond that first iteration. As a project, it includes both open workshops as well as creative processes. Now seems to be a good time to take stock and showcase what has been a sacred and empowering journey not just for me but for many women I have had the fortune to work with.

Drishti Rakhra,"The online space has been heavily theorised as an extension of ourselves. A tap on our phones prompts the wakening of a self that is pieced together more thoughtfully (thoughtlessly, some might say) than our regular, everyday selves. Academicians like Sherry Truckle have worked with this second self very closely; trying to understand what contributes to our extended selves. Truckle says that every time we make ourselves available online, we are ‘editing, deleting, and retouching’ ourselves. 

Over the last year and a half of the pandemic, I have met several hundreds of people, all of them students, all of them presented to me in little boxes (through display pictures chosen very carefully). By some miracle, I have been able to witness their learning even through these boxes. They remain staunch individuals with unique identities, but these identities are inherently fluid. They have found friends in each other, they have learned to be jealous of each other, to be fond of each other — all through a careful curation of the self. 

How does this process work? How do we present ourselves? Is your hair short, or do you upload that one picture from months ago, when your hair was much longer? Which clothes do you wear? One of the edits implicit in the process of this everyday decision-making is the (re)presentation of our gender. As a woman, do you edit and chip away to accommodate the presence of trolls? Do you self-censor till you appear calmer? Or are you much louder in the online space than the offline has ever allowed you? As a man, do you easily fall into conversations that get away from you very quickly? If you identify differently, what do these conversations look like?

In 1993, Judith Halberstam wrote a paper speaking of gender as an extension of technology. What does this mean? Our second (third, and fourth selves) exist not as a manifestation of ourselves, but as a digital product, presented to others on the basis of algorithms built for the other. Who do we interact with, then? What assumptions do we make about them? Do we build echo chambers for ourselves, until the only voice we’re hearing is a mimicry of our own? The answer to all this, as has been established repeatedly (The Social Dilemma, for example), is a very clear yes. Our online selves are products. Halberstam’s response to this is a very simple one. She says that in a world of binaries, the only factor that prevents us from becoming mindless data is our desire for pleasure. This desire is what survives in our capitalist, data-driven world. 

So the question I ask is this: in this fight for ourselves, in this world of performative binaries, who do we decide to be?","The project itself is a creative curation of conversations between 10 strangers. I will put together a group of 10 volunteers who will be in conversation with each other for about two weeks. They will be given a set of rules: don’t reveal your gender, don’t reveal your city, your caste, or any identifier that will help the other person locate you. At the beginning of the project, each person will write a short self-portrait, and at the end of the two weeks, each person will write a profile of the person they have been in conversation with. The grand finale of this process will be a reveal - all the volunteers will meet each other and speak to the rest of us about what this process has been like for them.

Since my project is contingent upon the conversations that these 10 people will have, I have imagined the final product to look like a few different things.

One possibility for this project is an online Zine. I imagine this Zine to be a non-linear narrative of gender and intimacy. A reader of the zine can pick which narrative works for them—what identities are we able to create for ourselves outside of the age-old ones? This Zine will be a multimedia zine that will reflect the slightly messy process of figuring out who we are. I have been trained in design and will be making the zine on my own. 

Another vision takes me to an interactive website, where each audience member walks with me through the journey of witnessing the conversations that took place on Discord. Audience members can be involved in the process of guessing gender, of guessing identity. The narrative of the website will also follow some kind of non-linear structure. If the project has the space for it, I hope to bring an illustrator on board and get them to create illustrations of each person sans gender.

I plan to end the project with a series of conversations and interviews, so the website/zine will make use of multimedia elements like soundbytes and video footage that closely looks at what each person has learnt about themselves and about whatever idea of gender exists in their minds. I will also use text and screenshots of the conversations that the volunteers have with each other, and so the experience of looking at the project will be layered. Irrespective of the form it will take, I am certain that the project will involve different media and play on our own relationships with technology. 

Effectively, the project takes a closer look at what we’re able to do in the online space with our digital identities. In the absence of the digital space, we function differently, and so do our genders.
","1. Rs. 15,000: Remuneration for volunteers. Each volunteer will spend about 30 mins to 1 hour of their day for two weeks having conversations with a stranger. A small token amount will work as incentive and will also finalise the contract that they will sign at the start of the project ~ 1000-1500 per volunteer = Rs. 10,000 - Rs 15,000 

2. Rs. 19,0000: Software license - for this project, I will need to use various software such as Indesign, Illustrator, Audition, Premiere, and Photoshop. The student/teacher license for the entire Adobe package comes up to about 19,000 ~ Adobe package = Rs 19,000

3. Rs. 30,000: While I have been trained in Indesign and Website management, I will require help from a professional graphic designer to bring this project to life. The illustrator will work on a set of ten illustrations, each based on the profile that every volunteer has written. Illustrator = Rs. 30,000

4. Rs. 7,000: A basic website costs about Rs. 5000 to launch. I will use either Wix or Wordpress to launch the interactive website. Website = Rs. 7,000
","My name is Drishti Rakhra. I am a reader, writer, and teacher at St. Joseph’s College, Bengaluru. I have an MA in English from Ambedkar University, and I spend most of my days moving from one MS Teams meeting to the other. In the little time that I have left, I try to cram in conversation, reading, and writing. 

I was recently longlisted for The Bombay Review 20 Under 30 Anthology of Short Fiction, and am currently working on a series of short stories that explore ideas of difference and queerness within our homes. I have been published on The Ladies Finger, The Open Dosa, HuffPost India, and Agents of Ishq. I write semi-regularly on www.veronicaoberoi.com, where I upload a series of pieces called Sunday Women, in addition to other things. I am very intrigued by the world of women—worlds created with so much care and love, that they appear like some kind of utopia. On days when I am not doing all these things, you’ll find me binge watching Masterchef Australia. ","My project is a sum total of my curiosities. These curiosities are two-fold, but they boil down to one question: how do we present ourselves in the online space? Our identities are constantly shifting, more so with the prevalence of a slightly restrictive online discourse. If one were to quickly glance through Twitter or Instagram, it’ll become clear that there is some amount of anger and defiance in conversations of exploration. In the space of my online classroom, students seem to be sure that they are the most politically correct, that they have arrived at some zen moment of learning. There are many problems with this belief, but the biggest one is that it restricts exploration. What are we expecting out of others in conversations? How much of ourselves do we offer to the other? The texture of this intimacy is such that it must follow a pattern that has already been established. The performativity of the online space seems to precede gender. We end up becoming versions of the people we see, the people we talk to. 

All these conversations happen in the English language. The language of wokeness and performativity. What happens when one finds other languages in which to communicate? If we lighten the load on ourselves to perform correctly (and ascribe to a binary), does that enable us to reconfigure who we are? What if we were to remove this performativity and arrive at our genders through another route? Through intimacy and connections?","At the age of 15, I gave myself a new name. I was called Veronica Oberoi on Facebook and made several friends in the Indian daily-soap fandom. It was very clear that most of the people there were using pseudonyms. I knew nothing about their lives, except for vague details like whether they liked cooking or not. Eventually I found out that several of these people were 30+ women with robust home lives. They had to cook, they had to keep the house running, they had to be wives. Until that reveal, I would’ve never guessed that I was speaking to women I had very little in common with. This epiphany has driven much of the work I have done in my adult life. 

I write regularly, and publish on a website called www.veronicaoberoi.com In the past, I have written about identity, women, queer lives, films, and books. Last year, I spent a couple of months closely analysing the context of Miranda July’s work. July uses the online space to play with narrative and identity. I have also extensively written about the online fandom world: a world in which women are the ones in charge, worlds dominated by pleasure and desire. I have recently also ventured into Digital Humanities, and was able to complete an introductory MOOC. I hope to continue working at the intersection of gender and technology, for it is exactly where I exist.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Nb_lTeyYy8DJdrvEXQD8zFaKE1j5w2cY
Kanchan Avchare,"Synopsis: ‘Nights Through A Window’
It is a time of the day (night) where there is freedom from what society wants us to be, we can be ourselves, we can breathe, but the residue of the day leaves us lifeless and hopeless. And from there comes this performance, different women of different ages trying to connect, communicate; humour, comedy, tragedy and various emotions emerges. It will be played out inside a carton box making it like a window behind which the performance is played. The melting of lights, sounds, breathes, characters will bring moving images of women spending their nights. The play will be narrated by a man who tells about women of his life, mother and wife. The performance will be recorded and will be seen online as recorded video, thereafter the audience can reach the performer through messages in an input box visible after the performance where they can share their stories which will be displayed as a page ‘stories of my nights’ after every next performance in the screen. This will help women to come forward to share their most intimate self. The work is in progress, I have shot some making process scenes. The performance will need research of talking to different women to know their stories to convert them into performance, some characters are me, some are my mother, aunts, dadi, bua, didi, and many such women I have observed from very close. This research will happen in meeting and calls. The stories will be gathered as raw material and weaved into a theatre performance.
Stories already work in progress are
A Mother putting baby to sleep.
An old woman trying to watch T.V
A young girl towards a suicide attempt
A woman finishing her daily chores 
These situations are filmiscal and fantasy filled with lights, sounds and colours.
It is a solo play trying to get away with the dialogues and conventional theatre making styles, it focuses on breath, movement, images.
","“I want to hear more stories of how women spend their nights other than sleeping especially when they are alone.”
The performance will be a recorded video that will be available to see to the audience.
Once the performance is over the audience will get a pop-up input box that will ask them to enter their stories of the night, (their intimate and hidden lives or the burdens that they carry throughout the day and how they remove it in the night once they are back in their nests)
Theses stories will be added on in the page called ‘stories of my nights’, every time a new story will be entered by an audience. The page will be visible to the other audiences after the performance video ends.
So, for this a platform will be needed as input and other as the displayed page, that will be designed by some of my friends working in software development area. The talk is on to negotiate on the needs and outputs of the work.","1.Research work: Rs 8,000 
I suppose for travelling and connecting to the women of different ages, roles, class, there will be a significant time and money needed. Meetings will end up with some refreshments and travel charges will be basic amounts of petrol. There will be also calls and online meetings. Add ons will be stationary charges. The research work will be for the first month, October, 2021
2. Lights and materials: Rs 10,000
Buying costumes, clothes, properties, stitching charges, set making, certain type of lights will be needed to buy. Lights will be a vital component of the play. Ebery thing will be resourced in October, 2021.
3.Camera recording: Rs 10,000
This will be an important and end part of the project, hiring a good cameraman and getting good video will be crucial. It will be done at the end of November, 2021.
4. Platform construction to let audience enter their stories: Rs 20,000
This will be taken once the play making has happen and will be covered in the month of December by the team of software developer friends. It will be the most costly part but at the same time it will be crucial to hear from the audiences what they have to tell as their stories after the performance, it will be the interactive part of the story and yet they will not have to face anybody.
5. Honorarium to the artists: Rs 10,000
There will be help from artists to put lights, set making, muisc making or playing. 

So, total budget ends upto Rs 58,000
        
","When theatre entered my life, it was more about the enacting of the given text but gradually I started to observe the unwritten subtext. The language spoken by a region confines the communication between a performer and the audience. I believe in non-verbal communication, the one which is through movements, gestures, expressions…I explored the movements-based process to devise my solo play based on conditioning of women which is not confined to a region but is relevant universally (Happily Tagged Ever). 
I realized how we are conditioned to block our senses and develop inhibitions with the growing age, a child is free than a grown up and that is because of the blocks on the grownup mind. We forget to explore our body and voice and restrict it to the structured actions we perform every day. I strongly believe to express the ideas and thoughts by using the process of exploring the impulses and the reactions of the body. I am very inclined to find out ways to reach performance through our roots of strong practices of body and voice like in Kutiyattam, Kalarippayattu for which I travelled to Kerala in 2017.
In 2019, I got INLAKS theatre grant award for researching elements from traditional forms in the contemporary actor training.
‘Towards Transformation’, NityaKriya and Aabharanam 
A research document on how elements can be taken put into practice to achieve transformation needed in a performance.
In 2020, I was desperate to get back to stage but pandemic restricted so I started to research about site specific theatre in which audience can be distant and moving in an open space and hence theatre can yet again happen live!
For this I received a research grant from Kolkata Centre for Creativity.

","” This project is a work in progress performance of my intimate moments of night where my gender and its role made me helpless. I hail from Madhya Pradesh, I live in Kerala with my one-year-old baby, 
and I make theatre performances that DEFY and re-DEFINE the culture that tries to put me in a place of helplessness. 
I have lived nights and many nights putting my new born to sleep and finding myself with no help.
This piece of theatre comes from the dark space of my heart where there is an artist who have spent countless nights
putting her baby to sleep, washing dishes, writing her to do list, feeling suicidal, and many such things.
I wonder how women spent their nights when they are not sleeping.""
This solo piece will be an expression to the nights women around us spend, the tiredness of day, pretense, stereotypes, culture all that boxes them in some role is questioned and highlighted here through some moving images of theatre.","Happily Tagged Ever
The last theatre performance that I made up as a solo was called 'Happily Tagged Ever' in 2016 which ran many places like open stages, colleges, streets, theatres. that encounters various stages of life for a woman starting from menstruation to body slamming, slut shaming, marriage, make up; every thing is covered up here in the form of devised movements and poetry in English and Hindi.
A sarcastic and searing comment on lives of women who have accepted themselves as what they have been conditioned to be for so many years to be. It is moreover a collection of poems (in a non-linear format) that sometimes bang your head and other times slowly stir emotions. 
Synopsis
The last time you had to
Ask for a pad and carry it hiding from the public.
Check your curves before wearing a dress.
Cover your face with make up to just look presentable.
Answer, “Are You a Virgin?”
Hear “Stop being a girl.”
Raze up your body to show it up.
 
All this fuzz on being a female?
                               
The solo might sound feminist and yes it is! And it’s not a blame against men and society but questions everyone humbly, about the conditioning which have resulted in the tagging and labeling of the she gender.
But lets face it who are we to judge?

Vastavikta,"The dominant socio-cultural narrative consolidated through time with caste and gender biases have put forth a singular identity /idea of an ideal household. The narrative produced is exclusionary and problematic, where imagery of an ideal family such as ‘Hum do. Humare do’  consisted of affixed gendered configurations of a ‘man’, a ‘woman’ and their offspring a ‘boy’ and a ‘girl’ is still deemed socially acceptable and thus eliminating the entire gender spectrum. Within this framework any form of gender non-conformity and queerness outside this configuration of the ideal family is termed as invalid which in turn has through time an implication on the visceral experience of inhabiting physical and digital spaces. For example, I have friends who are a non binary couple living in a studio in a metropolitan city, four women rent a flat in a second tier town and many such households that function as the same and are built on gender solidarities and friendships come to put together the notion of a home beyond the physicality of a flat or studio that is relatively unique based on the spaces and networks accessible to them. These gendered solidarities and configurations are however not accounted for and are invalidated as household structures that  lead to implications on access to social security as well as  impact the idea of publicness and its access. 

To unravel and make visible these experiences and complexities I would like to put together through a series of portraits of homes, experiences of gendered and queer households. Here, for the project, I see the home as any lived space holding complex relationships beyond affixed gender identities and roles. The home is also a space that is made over time through organization of geographies, space, furnishings and adapting, and it refers to how we live( Gupte and Iyer, 2021). Further, taking from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s The Danger of a Single Story I feel that through this project it is important to undo this singular narrative constructed around household configurations and the ideas of home that are produced so far. Thus  the project seeks to explore ‘How does one construct the idea of home beyond the dominant contemporary narrative and account for queer and gendered experiences of home through listening closely and further drawing out these story portraits of these households in the contemporary. 

Here the idea of looking at a household as a unit in the contemporary becomes a viable scale to engage with, even more so after the pandemic, where bodies, grief and memories are forced within the confines of this physicality. The idea of the contemporary and the method of piecing these stories is put together from the novel Midnight’s children being akin to a cinema, where you are watching a movie with your nose to the screen. ‘All you see is pixels.’(Gupte et al 2020).’ I intend to see the contemporary as a collection of these multiple pixels of unique gendered household experiences in order to construct and account for and bring forth multivalent ideas of the home and households beyond the binary. And thus through stories and fictions bring forth softer stories of inhabitations, solidarities, claims, friendships, breakages and spillages that come to form the notions of home across genders by reading together through these pixels. And thus in the process, to see each pixel next to the other and tell the next pixel its unique story, in order to piece a larger narrative filled with dissonant pixels which are equally valid but excluded this far around conceptualizing household, gender and home. 

I intend to use deep listening to construct these portraits and self portraits of homes in gendered and queer households through conversations, images, visuals and recorded sound. These portraitures firstly will act as mirrors of everything around us - dwelling on gender and caste identities in space. The portrait here might become an embodiment of the physical feeling of inhabiting the idea of home, pieced through sound, noise, audio, found objects and images, conversations, messages. The digital here becomes a space of collecting these unique formulations of home and generating a landscape where storytelling and fiction can be mobilized where necessary. It also becomes an effective mode of dissemination to produce a visceral  experiential archive around  the idea of home  and its experience by queer and gendered households through these portraits. 
","The digital in the current times is political as well as a spatiality that allows for the existence of multiple claims possible by  opening up geographies and temporalities like never before. It has the ability to  also allow for democratic inhabitations. The current times have seen a sensorial reconfiguration - the dependence on the eye and ear has substantially increased. And what we hear and see are largely mediated sound and images - mediated through the digital. Thus this project seeks to engage with the experiential dimension of experiencing gendered and queer formulations of home by creating an openly accessible archive through the help of the digital.  

My interest lies in the intersection of narrative drawings and the digital as a space for visceral engagements beyond geographic and temporal boundaries. Here through writing code and designing interactions, I intend to engage with collected mediated sound and image along with narrative methods of drawing to stitch a landscape of the home for a series of households. This space will also allow an individual to meander and discover the notion of home based on the way they chose to interact with the digital portraits in the archive. By this I mean, the physicality of the home will not be directly replicated, rather I intend to use the visceral qualities of space such as coherent or dissonant sounds, light, moving images, notes and texts along with narrative drawings collected over the course of the project to design  hybrid digital inhabitations. While one can enter the archive through fixed entry points through a series of at least 10 portraits of different conceptualizations of unique households, it will also allow for no two experiences to be the same as they will be solely guided by how one inhabits, interacts and navigates the space of these portraits which are hyperlinked through multiple points within them.

I have been experimenting with such a possibility of inhabiting the digital space and the same can be accessed through the website links shared in the application and sample of works.

","I am an  architect, artist and assistant professor at the School of Environment and Architecture, Mumbai who works with drawing out narratives, data, language and archives. My pronouns are she/her. I write code and have been experimenting with the digital space through the idea of new forms and experiential dimensions of archives and exhibitions. The recent project that I was involved with that showcases these abilities and interests was the Covid  Glossary: https://covidglossary.net/  and Exhibition: https://www.covidglossary.online/ supported by the Akademie der Künste der Welt, Cologne as part of their initiative ‘Times of Hands’ and Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan Mumbai.
 
My current work also focuses on the spatial and environmental politics surrounding post-intensive mining landscapes and climate change in Indian cities. For the latter, I am researching a wide range of household experiences and responses to wetness in suburban Mumbai. This involves engaging with individuals inhabiting the estuarine landscape within the geography of Mumbai by collecting  and drawing out their experiences of the everyday and climate change.  For the earlier, drawing on a year-long Research Associateship at SEA (2018), I am  concurrently developing a graphic novel and journal article manuscript on the contestations surrounding the futures of Goa’s mining landscapes through its multiple claims that have dimensions of indigeneity and gender.  In the past I have also been a Field Stations 2019 Fellow under the Wright Ingraham Institute and worked in the Antioquia region of Colombia. 
","I intend to through softer experiential portraits of gendered and queer households destabilize  the conventional idea of family and home. Through the drawing of the portrait of the home through a collage of image and sound, the project sees our spaces of inhabitation between a spectrum of being soft and nimble to harsh and rigid. Here the spectrum of gender identities claim and reclaim these spaces through their bodies, objects and memories that enable and allow for solidarities and friendships. Thus I propose that home isn't a container with walls but rather a gendered landscape claimed through unique gendered and queer identities.  At the same time the space of the home is intimate and yet a reflection of the society we inhabit, our fears and afflictions. The landscape of home is one with immense complexities. The drawing out of these complexities through the lens of queer and gendered households helps me think about space and gender through possibilities of softer inhabitations and alternative conceptualization and landscapes of home  beyond the binary that dominates the contemporary socio-cultural view. The digital dimension of the project becomes a   response of/from the visceral world to these times, where physicalities have been rendered irrelevant.
","A sample of my work can be accessed online from the following website:  https://sea-css.in/Vastavikta-Bhagat . 

I have always been interested in the narrative traditions of drawing out spatiality and the contestations that come to shape it. These contestations are gendered, based on indigeneity, caste and emerge from socio-cultural differences. How does one allow and account for multiple smaller claims and narratives to piece together the landscapes of imagination? This interest of engaging with the field has been the core interest of my work and I believe it is antithetical to the idea of a meta narrative that flattens out claims and contestations. Here the idea of the narrative drawing, the journal and deep listening to evoke visceral experiences of space become integral frameworks and mediums through which my work is shaped. Some of these engagements have culminated in  drawings and graphic novels to democratize the understanding of space and knowledge. 

Further, over the last three years, how one can build on these visceral experiences digitally at the same time allow for multiplicities and representation of numerous  voices has led me to gravitate towards the digital. Skills of writing code and conceptualizing digital forms of these experiences through archives and exhibitions is something I have built on that interweaves with my ethnographic methods of study and representation. The architecture of putting together the work to create unique personal  inhabitations in this relatively new space of the internet is something I work with through granular stories collected.

Shwetal Bhatt,"“I am not what I think I am. 
I am not what you think I am, 
I am, what I think, you think I am.” – Charles Cooley

We form our sense of self largely through the gaze of others. Using real life social interactions as a kind of mirror, we construct our identities based on how we believe others view us. This process of constructing our identities has in some ways been disrupted by the proliferation self-gaze mirrors. The most pervasive in recent times being Zoom where we are relentlessly obliged to watch ourselves as we interact with others. Yet, this reflection of ourselves we see on Zoom is nothing like our heavily curated selfie. In the unfiltered spontaneity of Zoom, we catch our unpremeditated selves in action. The self that is familiar to others but has largely been elusive and invisible to ourselves. And we are fascinated and surprised by it. 

How does this constant self-gaze shape the landscape of our identities? Are we comfortable with what we see? What happens when the “actor” and “spectator” is one and the same person? How do we edit ourselves in real time? 

“See Me” is an experimental Zoom project by Shereen Saif and Shwetal Bhatt that reflects on these questions. Shot on Macbook over a live call, Zoom becomes both a mirror and a window into one’s own surroundings. The home becomes a stage and conversations with self and “others” in the digital realm become drama in this one actor, one space, one shot film. Set in the anxieties of 2021, the film offers a slice of life as the character attempts to find solace in Zoom, self-talk and mundane routines. In the absence of the gaze of others self-gaze becomes less about narcissism and more about compassion and validation of one’s existence as a real, embodied presence in the world. 
","The seed for this project came from the many conversations we’ve had on Zoom. Shereen and I live in two different parts of the world and have never actually met each other. Ours is a friendship and collaboration forged entirely in the digital space – very telling of the times we live in. The proposed project, shot and edited on Macbook, will be executed virtually end-to-end right from conceptualization to production meetings, performance, edit, sound design and eventual screening. 
“See Me” is a project devised on Zoom for Zoom. 

The final output will be a performance film of approximately 10mins with a live and interactive component. While the film is shot from the point of gaze of the performer, the screening will invite the gaze and scrutiny of spectators. The spectators will also be cued to respond to specific questions by commenting live. 
These comments will feed into constructing multiple fictional identities for the character they see in the film.

","Shwetal Bhatt is an alumna of the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU Baroda. She is a Bangalore-based designer, multimedia artist, educator, and a mom. Shwetal is the founder and principal designer at FoDoMe, an independent design studio and a creative lab. Shwetal works in various 2D and 3D mediums to explore her creative range. She is a part time art and design educator, teaching at school and University level.
Her recent work includes the documentary film “Ramji Thakkar Bhimji Thakkar” based on the Navratri Festival of Baroda. Other than “See Me”, an experimental, collaborative Zoom project with performer Shereen Saif, she is working on a design assignment to create an alternative educational space.

Shereen Saif is a Dubai based Indian multi-disciplinary artist with a practice that spans dance, theatre, storytelling, voice acting and visual arts. Her foundation is diverse and has deep roots in Dance, Theatre and Architecture. Her movement vocabulary is shaped by her training in the Indian classical traditions of Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kathak under Kalamandalam Sujatha, Dr Neena Prasad and Pali Chandra respectively. She is a LAMDA (London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art) certified acting professional and has since 2015 continued to train in ancient Indian theatre practices under Kutiyattam exponent and scholar, Venu G. 
A founding member of Star Too – Dubai’s first experimental theatre project, Shereen’s multidisciplinary approach to performing arts have resulted in creative collaborations that combine movement, theatre, music, video art and technology. Featured as one of 40 Power Players in the UAE (Feb 2019), she is currently a fellow of the Salama bint Hamdan Al Nahyan Emerging Artists Fellowship Programme 2021.
","“See Me” is conceptualized and shot from a definite female gaze – a gaze that seeks to empathize with the subject rather than objectify her. The subject is given complete agency to play and gaze at herself without being held under the scrutiny of another’s gaze. The project sees people as people and not so much through the defining lens of gender. 

As women, we are bodies under constant scrutiny and at the same time invisible. This film comes from the need to break away from notions of sexual identity and the entrapment of the female body with its hormones and physicality. It celebrates a woman in a gender free, timeless and nameless virtual space. 

Is not being spoken about in the gender space a liberating space for women? 

","Shwetal’s creative pursuits have been a process of self-discovery and inquiry into her surroundings. Led by curiosity and a sense of submission, her work is a palimpsest of materials and thoughts. Shwetal’s works in natural foraged materials is an attempt to observe how the subconscious interacts and submits to the material. She is drawn to film making as a medium to explore the intangible. Shwetal's work is reflective of her lived realities direct in representation and yet restrained in making a point. 

Shereen’s art practice is deeply rooted in the Indian ethos. It seeks the sacred in the mundane and the mundane in the sacred. Gestures, symbolism and ritual form an integral part of her work. She is drawn to craft as much as technology. Her multidisciplinary approach to performing arts have resulted in creative collaborations that combine movement, theatre, music, video art and technology.

Saad Khan,"The project titled ‘Doing Queer Research: Digital zine and Podcast series in Bangladesh’ aims to produce knowledge and critical conversation about queer research, ethics, and methodology in Bangladesh through the creative medium of a digital zine and podcast series. Due to political intolerance, academic rigidity, and a general culture of silence and violence when it comes to addressing concerns of sexuality, research on queer issues has been minimal in Bangladesh. This project intends to initiate conversation about queer research in Bangladesh through the expansive and inclusive format of a digital zine and podcast series with scholars working on gender, sexuality, and queer politics in Bangladesh and South Asia. The zine and podcast series will be uploaded on ‘Oboyob Diversity Circle’s website. Oboyob is the longest running and oldest LGBTQ group in Bangladesh.  
 
The peak period of LGBTQ visible activism and organizing around non-normative sexuality politics in Bangladesh took place between 2009-2016, when a sense of LGBT or queer community gained credence through advocacy work and various public events. However, the nascent movement shifted and went underground in 2016 when two prominent activists were murdered by Islamic militants. This caused a visible backlash, resulting in immediate stalling of most programs and initiatives, forcing several leading activists and allies to leave the country for safety. Within such context of sociocultural intolerance, queer scholarship - scholarship on queer issues, and queer forms of scholarship - can provide produtive routes to reflect on and navigate violence, and imagine and implement diverse forms of queer organizing, agency, networks of support, and resistance in Bangladesh.    
 
The non-linear/academic form of zine provides grounds for artistic expressions, organizing, and forming communities for queer people. The digital zine in this project will be a visual representation and interpretation of Bangladeshi scholar Shuchi Karim’s PhD dissertation on LGBT community members and activists in Bangladesh written in 2012. Karim’s work is significant as it was written during a point in time when the incipient LGBT scene in Bangladesh was beginning to take visible forms. In many ways, it is the first and one of the very few ‘documents’ on LGBT lives in Bangladesh. Since then, very little scholarship on queer issues has been produced in Bangladesh. The visibility of the LGBT scene was short lived, however Karim’s work provides a new generation of queer activists and scholars in Bangladesh a reference and referral point to think about changing landscapes of queer politics in Bangladesh. Since the dissertation is written in academic English, and largely for an academic audience, the zine will make a critical intervention of transforming Karim’s dissertation and making it accessible by representing sections of it in illustrated and other visual forms. Doing so, this project intends to foster an inclusive readership on queer research and scholarship in Bangladesh. The zine’s visual representation of Karim’s work will enable readers from various positionalities to engage with the content of Karim’s work, as well as think of the question: What forms can queer scholarship take in Bangladesh?
 
Digital spaces have been used to create communities and counter-publics in Bangladesh and larger South Asia. Digital space also emerged as an important site to sustain community activities in Bangladesh during the covid pandemic. However, there is no virtual space to have dialogues about queer scholarship. The podcast series will begin the dialogue and enable a platform to converse with scholars working on queer issues, and conducting research across art, activism, and development in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. They will be invited in each episode to participate in interviews about their queer scholarship and discuss the diverse ways one can do queer research and impact positive change in society. The conversations will be in Bengali and English. The podcast series will enable trans-regional dialogues about queer politics across intersections of gender, sexuality, class, caste, nationality, and religion in South Asia.
 
The zine and podcast will provide frameworks and tools to individuals working at intersections of art, academia, and activism to understand and navigate present complex moments and realities of agency, representation, and violence that LGBTQI+ people experience in Bangladesh and larger South Asia. The zine and podcast will be used as texts in conducting future community-based workshops on ‘Queer research’ in Bangladesh. Tanvir Alim (Little Boxes) and Saad Khan are currently pursuing PhD in the topics of gender, sexuality, and queer politics in Bangladesh. Their backgrounds in artistic, activist, digital advocacy and interdisciplinary research work, effectively position them to conduct this project.
","There is a growing demand for digital illustration and audio among LGBTQ community in Bangladesh. The audio-visual content on queer scholarship produced through the zine and podcast will be unique and first of a kind in Bangladesh. The digital zine and podcast series will utilize the digital space to disseminate knowledge and initiate conversations on queer research and advocacy work. The zine will have a digital format, for which it will be possible to circulate it among LGBTQ community members (living in Bangladesh and abroad) more easily to improve queer research literacy. 

Both the zine and podcast series will be uploaded on Oboyob’s website. Oboyob is the oldest and longest running LGBTQ group in Bangladesh. Oboyob launched an interactive audio-visual e-book exhibition in 2021. The zine and the podcast series will be similarly uploaded and available for LGBTQ community members and allies to read, print, and hear on their own. With an increasing digital access among citizens in Bangladesh, more and more young people are being able to avail the internet in urban and rural areas. This means that young LGBTQ members in urban and rural spaces will be able to access the digital zine and podcast once they are uploaded in Oboyob. 

The younger generation who express their thoughts by utilizing digital tools and spaces and those who are interested in art, activism, and academia, will be able to link their real-life experiences with activist and academic discussions that this project will initiate in digital format. The zine and writings by scholars (invited at the podcast) will be shared digitally with different groups of LGBTQ individuals to submit questions for the invited scholars. This collective practice of thinking with the scholars will encourage young LGBTQ community members to become interested in raising critical questions and creating digital and non-digital spaces to have critical conversations about gender and sexuality. 

The zine and podcast will be password protected to ensure safe access and distribution. Knowledge made accessible through the digital space will reach online audiences that can be used to have specific forms of interactions and generate interest on research design in producing reading clusters and collectives. The digital space will also enable us to conduct transnational dialogues with scholars located in different parts of the world. Such forms of digital engagements will ultimately open windows for further collaborations among artists, activists, scholars, and institutions at small and large scales. Based on the success and reception of the project, we intend to extend and sustain the conversation on gender, sexuality, and digital scholarship by turning the podcast series into an ongoing series and producing a graphic anthology on learning about and practicing ethnography, art, and activism.

","Little Boxes have curated and managed several queer art initiatives to embrace diversity through interdisciplinary art in Bangladesh. Their work makes a reference to (re)presentation and questions about 'speaking for'. Apart from producing arts, they also write art reviews in the local newspapers and other independent publications. They are  in charge of content development and publications of the art residency program titled 'Kalik'. They got nominated as an inspiring individual for promoting freedom and equality by fiveFilms4freedom in the 2016 Global List. In  the same year they also completed their fellowship at the Human Rights Watch, New York in their LGBT division and for their contribution to the community, they have been awarded for International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) 2017 by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. 

Saad Khan is a PhD candidate in the Dept. of Gender, Women, and Sexuality studies at University of Washington. He is researching LGBTQ politics in Bangladesh. Saad has extensive background as a qualitative researcher in the areas of gender, sexual and reproductive health and rights, masculinity, disability, and education. Saad has published academic and non-academic essays, and has produced cultural texts (documentary, comic strip, booklets) around the issues of gender, sexuality, and diversity. Saad has conducted local and international workshops on LGBTQ politics, queer research, advocacy work, and grant writing. Saad has received international fellowships from the US Dept. of State, Swedish Institute, and The Social Science Research Council.  
","The digital zine and podcast series will make the important intervention in enabling critical dialogues on gender, sexuality, and queerness to take place creatively within contexts of heteropatriarchy in Bangladesh and South Asia. The zine will be based on Shuchi Karim’s dissertation which is about the gendered and classed realities of LGBT people, and how that enables individuals to navigate private and public spheres in Bangladesh. The podcast series will hold conversations about doing scholarship on difficult issues like gender, sexuality, and LGBTQ politics in Bangladesh and South Asia. Scholars will be prompted to talk particularly about the ways gender identity and sexual orientation are interconnected, and influence the ways we do research and navigate relationships and power relations with research participants. The non-hierarchical nature of a zine and podcast will allow conversations about research taking place in expensive ways and traversing linguistic barriers that are often placed by heteropatriarchal structures of academia. These feminist concerns thus will inform the core tenets and guide the directions of this project. Being queer men ourselves, we will be also gearing conversations towards the themes of masculinity, sexuality, privilege, and power. Finally, the zine and podcast will act as imitable resources for conversations and workshop purposes within the Bangladeshi queer scene, as well for other stakeholders that LGBTIQ+ individuals and groups work and have various networks with such as feminist, public health, educational and legal aid organizations, and allies. ","Little Boxes have been advocating for queer rights through art for the last fifteen years believing art can bring social change. They take a deep interest in book art and independent publication. They envisioned and implemented ‘Project Dhee’ as a Project Supervisor back in 2015, which produced a comic strip featuring a lesbian character Dhee, the first of its kind in South Asia. At the moment the second chapter of the comic is under printing. In 2017, they curated a graphic anthology 'Boithoki Golpo' to archive the oral history of the queer communities in Bangladesh. I take a deep interest in book art and independent publication. 

Saad Khan believes in making scholarship accessible and inclusive through art and other creative mediums. Saad co-conducted ‘The masculinity project’ in 2015, which was a visual project that captures narratives of men in Bangladesh to begin dialogues on masculinity, sexuality, and power. He conducted another visual project on disability in 2017, where disabled participants through visual medium shared narratives of love, intimacy, and desire, creating an empowering space for self-advocacy. Saad created a digital archive for a university project using the digital platform of ‘Scalar’ where he digitally visualized the methodology of his research and exhibited it for a graduate seminar. Merging art, activism, and scholarship together and blurring their boundaries help advocate for intersectional forms of research work, and develop inclusive and radical praxis.

Bhagat Singh,"Trans-Bodique [When Salmons Swim Back To Life and Death]
A Body-Bender Proposal by Bhagat Singh and Niloy Roy

The Trans Bodique is a representation of mind within a body of a transgender in adolescence.  It's a study of the body changes, which becomes the object of doubt for self and 'display' thereafter for the world, where statements and notions dress the body of a transgender.

Gender and sexuality differences in a transgender body bring up questions that like, what does one reveal about oneself to others? How much to disclose and to whom? How to look for relationships? Where does one meet others like oneself? How does one access health, education, employment? How does one seek support without feeling obligated?
Conflicts between one’s internal reality and the way the world looks at them, can be a source of major distress. The issues start when one is at adolescence age and can feel the difference or have their differences pointed out. It is harder still when a person is gender-fluid, or in transition. The minority stress, or the experience of prejudice, oppression and discrimination is all too real in a person's age of adolescence. 

The relationship with one’s own body and the acquisition of a gendered social role – not necessarily binary – are by definition challenging for adolescents with gender dysphoria. 
Despite the barriers to legal gender affirmation for trans people, little is known about its association with mental health. Adolescents and adults who identify as transgender have high rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide. Evidence suggests that an identity of Transgender dysphoria has an increased prevalence among individuals with autism spectrum disorder, but this association is not yet well understood.

The body as a trigger:
You see your body
You try to understand your body.
Your family sees you.
Your neighborhood sees you.
The world sees.
The mind shrinks within the body and the body gets magnified by the abnormal gape.

Swimming back like salmon : The metaphorical representation of an adolescent mind of a transgender body

Salmons hatch in freshwater streams [family of orientation], travel miles downstream to the ocean [interactions at adolescence age], living there for years with their survival tactics against some ruthless predators in the open sea [the societal confrontation and struggle between mind and body]. However, in order to reproduce, they return back to that mountain stream, however far away that may be [the conflict of being the 'origin' of ideation in a body].
Salmons come back to the stream where they were 'born' because they 'know' it is a good place to spawn [trying to get back to secured entity]; they won't waste time looking for a stream with good habitat and other salmons [wherever they can find refuge]. Salmons change color to attract a spawning mate [finally ending up to a coloured delusion], ending up in death due to different factors after ovulation.
","The performance will be at the crux of digital Interaction between the live performer and audience, thereafter being followed by larger participation of secondary influencers.
As an applied digital media and performance project, this assignment examines the use of live performance and online story-mapping to (re)present marginalized narratives and local points of view. The use of digital media as a theatrical tool will be applied dramaturgically to reveal subtext and interior monologue, to create character, as a distancing and mediating element, a storytelling device, to express given circumstances, and to create dramatic counterpoints. The performers will represent the essentialism movement for performing with objects and audience, displacing spatial reality with interpolating live and processed video from the performing space as well as remote conditioned spaces.

With the help of digital technology, the performing space would not be limited to a physical one but the involvement of virtual spaces will provide a chance of interactivity on the part of both the performers and spectators present in physical as well as the digital spaces. The use of montages including historic images, images of concern, images of gaze , images of cruelty or torture, documented evidence, global events to induce an affect among the spectators as well bringing out the psychological duress of a character in front of the spectators. 

The sensorial experience of the spectators will be affectively influenced by the techniques of image graphics, sound effects, by interacting with the viewers to bring out a compliance so that do not remain limited to passive viewers but experience the subject of the performance closely and their experience becomes the part of the performance. There will be effective use of cameras, mobile devices, projection screens, personal as well public spaces, the liveness of the performance shall be maintained to instill a sensation of the real.

Bhagat Singh is a Ph.D. Scholar at Centre for Media Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi and a Guest Faculty at Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts, New Delhi. He completed his M.A. in economics from JNU, after which he devoted his time fully into filmmaking and theatre design. He completed his M.Phil in Media Studies from JNU specialising in New Media forms of theatre performances. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D in Media Studies from JNU focusing on “Stage, Performance and Senses: A Study of New Media Practices in Contemporary Indian Theatre”. As a filmmaker, he has directed short films and documentaries covering a wide range of social as well as political issues.
","Sexual orientation and gender identity are different entities, and transgender people present with a variety of sexual orientations. Nevertheless, sexual orientation has long been used to subtype GD/transsexualism. During adolescence, the different facets of sexual orientation – attraction, behavior and identity – may still be developing. It may be more important to determine whether adolescents with GD or transgender identity display developmentally appropriate and favorable involvement in understanding relationship with other sexes. In adolescence, sexual development accelerates. Young people’s experiences of a maturing and changing body, sexuality and their developing gender identity affect intrapersonal, interpersonal and societal interactions.

The Uneasiness: Humans on the whole are social creatures. What happens to your body, when you are not social anymore and everyone around keeps you in a despicable showcase of identities.The uneasiness with one's own body at puberty needs to be worked out to be easy way of entering a different world of age and understanding. However, the caged mind does not allow the body to grow into a fluid state of 'being', where it starts owning the responsibility of flowing back to normalcy of societal norms. The urgency of flowing back is a trap where the transgender body ends up being more of a bait to be ridiculed and further showcased as an object of unwanted times. 
","Patriarchy is one of the root causes of many social evils, depriving many of their own identities as well the social and political freedom they are fighting for whether it be women, dalits, marginalized religious as well as regional identities, tribals, adivasis, migrants, homeless, LGBTs etc. Our previous work has brought in focus the plight of such deprived sections. For example, in ‘Park Street’, the performance inspired from infamous Park Street Gangrape case brought out many uncomfortable questions about everyday abuse and the development of male gaze. It becomes increasingly relevant to explore the depth of an issue and understand the needs of various sections of the society not just from the view of inequality but from a view of human dignity as well. Our major idea remains not to announce a truth but for the audience to see their truth when they are face to face with the performance. The experience is designed not for someone particular but everyone based on what socio-political group they come from. The vary bane of society is the question of why does it exist and for what purpose; this question finds itself in the center of our performances and our minds while we attend to such an issue of utmost importance.

Aditi Kulkarni & Payal Arya,"Isolation, a solitary experience got a new meaning because of the pandemic. We seek the collective memory of a very personal, intimate moment in history. The window of the screen emerged as a mode to access these spaces. We invited people to share photogrammetry models of their isolation spaces and to tell us what isolation means to them. We provided them with instructions to create their own 3d models, putting together the fragments of media received from multiple participants and then we plan on fictionalizing it. Through the open call so far we have had entries from Germany, Czech Republic, Brazil, Seattle, India, Italy, Japan. The film explores the fragmented memories of individual spaces, integrating varied social and cultural backgrounds.
 
Through opening up these spaces, the visitor enters and trespasses the private places, which were closed off. The window of the screen emerged as a mode to access them.  

The current version is a photogrammetry film which has already been premiered at New Media Artspace, New York and is going to be shown at Wrong Biennale in Spain, TRANSBORDA 3 an international video art installation and shown on several tv channels in Europe and at VAICA 2 - a festival for Video Art by Indian Contemporary Artists. Our research was also published as part of the journal, “A fair new idea” Flanders Art Institute.
 
Link to the photogrammetry film: https://vimeo.com/603180168
 
We wish to expand the current version into two segments, a VR film/ Installation and a physical site-specific installation. For the Gender bender proposal we would like to pitch the VR version of the film. It would be disseminated and experienced virtually. 
The VR film would be 25 to 30 mins long, it would have 10 to 12 rooms and the viewer would enter one after the other being physically immersed within each section. The VR film narrative would be interwoven with micro stories of isolation, each space would give a glimpse of what the world has been going through. The stories would be varied and across different social strata's. Fostering community around the new media, the data collection generates an archival moment tying geographies of enclosed spaces.
The immersion created by the experience would provide a complete sensory engagement, where the viewer is enveloped in an alternate space oscillating between the real and digital. The photogrammetry is not only grounded to the material world but goes beyond it. To create a different type of immersion, where each isolation room holds its own emotional quotient. Mapping of emotions within the space, which then transcends into the viewer's experience. 

Sound plays an integral role within our installation, it helps to build the story to know the character who’s place the viewer inhabits. Ambi-sonic sound provides spatial cues for the visitor to enter one space after leaving another and being drawn into the multi-layered seamless experience of the story. Using sound, we are subconsciously leading the visitor’s gaze to heighten the exploration and to read all the cues in an increasingly fluid world. The passage through space is a ‘sequence of revelations’ rather than concealment or confusions. The sense of a ‘mystery unfolding ' becomes the great ‘drama' of the story. 
","
‘Memory is always in the periphery’ looks at the private through the digital lens and makes it public again. This project becomes a digital archive of a collective memory. It will be available in the public domain forever as a record of this poignant  moment in history. The project so far has been constantly expanding conceptually, in its form and also in terms of the contributors. 
The final form it will take will be a VR film experience. We will be creating an exhibition link for the viewer to download with a manual with instructions to make their own VR goggles just using their smartphone. They also have the possibility to experience the work in the form of a 360 film.

We would like each visitor to have their own unique experience. This indeterminate sense of immersion, in which the body cannot separate itself from the space it inhabits, produces profound disorientation, a sense of being lost. 

The current status of the production is, we have exported the 3d models from Agisoft and we are using Unity for stitching the worlds together, lighting and animation. We are also in the process of developing the narrative that will run through the experience in the form of a voice-over. Besides the photogrammetry model, we have also gathered images, videos, poetry and other forms of writing through the open call. 

We have high end DSLR cameras, ZoomH5 recorder, a VR Ready Computer and an HTC Vive, but need the grant to help us with this ambitious project. 

 We see the software as a creative tool and not something that just imitates reality, but an intersection between real and digital. One participant used 24 frames from a video, instead of clicking pictures. Error of not having information, in certain parts of the model became integral to overall aesthetic and concept.

Each space is three times removed from reality, first the way the person clicks the space and the resolution of the image. Through the software, certain information will get chosen and the lack of information, or white space or spaces where depth cannot be ascertained will look different when transformed into a 3d model. Third aspect comes in artistic intervention, in tying the spaces together.
 
Software flattens the field of visual effects, enabling messy encounters between images of various origins, at the same time enabling full immersion into these images. What are the effects of the digital in its complete takeover of space/spatial perceptions? Projection is no longer image-based but has now gradually become experience-based. 

The experience of time would be different for each person, using the animation feature in unity to change the sky box and the direction of the sun’s rays. We would like to mimic the dimension of ever changing time.

The project is led by Aditi Kulkarni and Payal Arya. Anokhi Shah and Alexander Papadopoulos, our collaborators, head the technical aspect of the project. 

Aditi and Payal have been working as an artist duo for 3 years. They were invited to Filmakademie Baden Württemberg as part of the International class in 2019- 2020, where they made their first film PIPIO, which then expanded in a VR and site-specific installation. Recently the film version of ‘Memory is always in the periphery’ premiered at New Media Artspace, New York and is going to be shown at Wrong Biennale in Spain, TRANSBORDA 3 an international video art installation and shown on several tv channels in Europe and at VAICA 2. Our research was also published as part of the journal, “A fair new idea” Flanders Art Institute. 
They were also invited to co-direct a short docu-fiction film by Filmakademie Baden Württemberg on “Corona, the world and me” which will soon be disseminated on various platforms and film festivals.  

Aditi works in a wide range of mediums and with a variety of subject matters. Aditi's expertise spread across the image, video, new-media practice, kinetic & spatial installations.

Collaborative work Aditi and Payal -  https://www.pipio-film.com","“Memory is always in the periphery” has a unique approach towards gender, the digitality breaks the binary of gender. The fragmented spaces represent the isolated memory of the individuals, you can almost never discern who’s space it is. The narrative story line in the VR piece, where each room will have a different voice-over and story will lead us to understand the story behind each space better. The physicality of the human body is almost always absent except for one female figure. 
 
Our project is aimed to be inclusive in every way, photogrammetry is something that is accessible by all but not known by all. The participants need only a mobile phone with a camera, hence any person from varied social strata could be a part of our project. Most people that submitted their worlds, were exploring 3d scanning for the first time. The project integrated people from all walks of life. We have also been using all the software that are either free of cost or with a 14 day trial period, ironically similar to the 14 day quarantine which this time has become too closely associated with. 
 
Being female directors, the nuances of looking at the software and our approach towards the technology, has a female point of view. Our language is organic and poetic, it has a fluidity to it which is not usually associated with technology.
","Aditi Kulkarni and Payal Arya are currently working on several projects as a duo as well as our individual artistic practice. 

We see our art practice as a mirror for the viewer to see themselves and vis-a-vis the world. As artists we want to employ various visual and conceptual strategies to question social and political structures. Our projects highlight the politics of the everyday in a poetic format. 
Our collective interest lies in exploring the idea of time through the medium of the image. 

We are interested in the experience of nonlinear time in the digital as well as the physical realm. We do not work with a fixed medium but our practice mutates through different forms, as per the concept. Having worked with installation for several years now, we are interested in creating experiences that are sensorial.

Our current preoccupation is also around new modes of dissemination, as we are forced to change our modes of social engagement in the current times.

She talks about the need for any person to understand the history of Modern Classical dances in India. As the discourse on the esotericism of Indian dances has in a way, shoved the social history of dance under the carpet. Questions that remained unanswered to be politically correct were attempted to be addressed. Dance in India is an integral part of the social and political history of India. This podcast aspired to bring forth that perspective. 

Our podcast “Pinjra Tod Kar” tells the story of Jameela Nishat’s Shaheen, an organisation that works with vulnerable women has broken multiple barriers. Through its work in rescue and rehabilitation of vulnerable women and helping those who have been victims of violence to get back on their feet, Shaheen has started important conversations towards structural and social change. This podcast won the Women’s Web Orange Flower Award for Most Empowering Podcast in 2020. 

The second season of Cyber Democracy podcast, hosted by digital rights researcher Radhika Radhakrishnan, focused on understanding how technology is a site for gendered politics in India. Through conversations with female and trans-queer grassroots practitioners, the podcast discussed how our gender and intersectional identities shape our experiences of and engagements with technologies and the Internet.

The links to the three podcasts are attached.

tenzin,"The idea here is to create an interactive, immersive environment for the audiences. This will be possible through using digital media software and the use of internet
For the past couple of years I have started working a lot with digital Sounds and visuals. I want to do a proper live music session and projections of visuals. The most fun part is that the audiences can interact with the Visuals as well. The visuals will be reactive to my playing or through audience’s body movements. The idea here is share visuals/dialogues/interviews/ audios or films focused on the subject Gender. The plan here is to use these responses, reactions of the public as parameters or the Data as ingredients for the project. The use of either Audio or Visuals has different properties. The inputs of data retained by the movement of the audiences or my music are received by the software touch designer, where I will have to explore the possibilities. The collected Data will be programmed to a certain task in a informative output format. As a musician (guitarist) and a big fan of electronic music I can feel the positive vibes to visualize the audiences having fun while interacting.  have the sound and the visuals go in synchronization. 
Finally this is the part where the Gender comes in play. The approach to the languages almost everywhere on earth is also divided in three parts The Feminine, The Masculine and Neutral. This I find fascinating as to how we decide upon what is what. How do we as human tend to categorize the gender and why. My expression or the Concept which I want to emphasis will be in two different segments
1-        The use of online platform to teach the machine to identify the Gender. I want to make it a comical and fun interaction also.
Here The audiences will have to choose a color paper from a container without looking, Every color will be given a specific terminology/body movement/facial expressions etc.. 
When the spectator is in front of the camera, the person will have to present the color paper. This then is captured through the machinelearning online platform, and will give out a response.
The idea here is to see how the human being choose  the color and they can also write and share why. The Writings of every individual gender and their choice of colors will be documented and used as data inputs for the next project.
2-        An interactive installation, with me playing live musical pieces composed by me. 
Here I want to encourage the audience to immerse themselves in the form of body movements and dance. The visuals projected will also include the motions of the audiences. 
Here I want to share the idea of how we all are one, a part of this big cycle. To show and share that when we dance there is no male or female, its like love and not science. 
I have tried out these two concepts. I have managed to teach the machine through Machine learning (ML) process to identity say a movement or objects. And with the Audio reaction I am have been able to execute so that the visuals are reactive to my Sounds.
","I am very much Inspired from Dada Art movement, I feel the need to ask why is the classification for  everything on the basis of the Feminine and the Masculine and Neutral. the installation will include Sounds interactions with the movement of the human form. During my graduation my co-Artist and I performed a live, acoustic, collective recitation performance Art in the Exhibition hall of Baroda FineArts. My idea was to involve the audiences irrespective of gender, Age, backgrounds etc. The Focus was to invite the people and involve them in the Collective Voices in our performance. That was the first time I had this idea.
Now with this Program I want to introduce the technology as a tool to enhance the interactions and to create an immersive atmosphere triggering all the senses. the translation of physical movements through Machine learning process and other inputs can help this process. Part of the project will be offline because I will have to set the parameters and start with a new composition for this project. The entire process will mean feeding information or data in so that the machine learns to do its task. Here the  major task is creating two different platforms in the same installation. 
1-        The machine recognizing the movement during interactionis  and responding 
2-        The sounds and visuals interact as a as the trigger to make the audience move with the music. This willl be projected on a .wall.
The machine learning part will all be an online mode of execution as the platform is used online. The part with visuals and projects are offline mode. Through these interactions a dialogue between the “information fed into the machine” and “ the observations made by both of the audiences and the machine” is something exciting. Eg. Teaching the machine to see “females” as “male” or vice versa. But then the hard copy questions will have answers written by the audiences. There are some exciting observations waiting to be discovered.

","Initiate research and collect the needed information with help of internet. Like any artist, tools are very important for being able to execute the needed Concepts. For me personally discovering this media where the sound and visual come together has made me more confident to do more. The presence of sounds and visuals will increase the interactivity and quality of experiencing the overall installation. 
 I am using Touch designer and Ableton (DAW) software( my main tools) to create the sound and Visual. The software Touch design is a unique software which enables me to incorporate music with my visuals, the current software version that I use is the most basic version which has limited features like resolution, no online streaming etc. 
If This Grant allows, I would want to invest the opportunity for the proper version of the Software  which costs $600 (approx 45,000 INR). Having the proper version  will allow me to explore, execute my ideas with various sensors, multiple external hardware inputs like connecting with more than one projectors during the projection mappings. I can create a lot of interaction using the online platform  using the prepared data sets ,like Google earth basically anything on API and using internet mode!  The purchase of this particular software will open up many various doors to explore the infinite possibilities of the coming future.      
find the correct hardware/software to execute the ideas. The process will be accompanied with drawings, sketches, note makings and music 
Creating a series of methods with help of AI or  ML with multiple use of sensors and cameras. The electronic components / hardware such as 
Touchdesigner Software – 600$ (TouchDesigner Commercial | Derivative )
Raspberry Pi  (8 GB Ram) –9,000 (to connect the sensors to the processor with teaching the machine through python codes)
Sensor, Camera sensors,  –2000– 3,000 INR
Other transistors , wires and plugs etc –8,000 INR
These instruments are important to make the interactive atmosphere for my works.
Softwares like p5j, posenet, touch-designer, Ableton and retaining 3d images are time taking task and needs a lot of research to acquire the proper data, some of which are required to pay. Not everything in the internet is freely available.
I may have to hire/seek help from a professional coder to help me execute the Data (through sensors, my live music compositions)  to be properly fed in the processor Raspberry Pi, then in the Machine learning online web portal. It will be very helpful if the organization has someone to whom I can seek guidance from.
","I am a Sound/Visual Artist from Mcloed Ganj but currently based in Vadodara. I am professionally trained in Sculpture-making, painting and in making Murals but I love experimenting. I have been doing work with sounds and music since I was a child, it was during the pandemic period that I started heeding this urge for fusing the  two (Sound and Visuals)  together. I have started a YouTube channel, and a podcast channel “Mix-Masala with T-G” in spotify, where I share information about Art, Music, Gender, Technology and The climate change” I enjoy working with traditional and the digital media. Before venturing into this parallel dimension of sounds, I was using the similar idea with the traditional disciplines of Fine arts during my time in the University. As a sculptor I thought the emotions of everyone, is it experienced in the same way and why is it displayed very differently. Every part of the body is labeled and so is everything. Being brought up by my Foster German mom, I was always up for experimenting my art with science. With my mother’s and siblings support I ventured into the world of music, Art and the nature. As mcloed ganj is the home for His holiness the Dalai Lama, I would always find myself interacting with people from various fields and practices. Especially the environment of spirituality that exists in the region has also somehow shaped my ways of looking at everything as a whole. The constant interaction of Buddhists and hindusim along with many other cultures my interest in subjects like spirituality, sexuality and the emotions came. That’s why much of my works are titled to the mental, gender, sex, states of myself or the individual.To have the opportunity to have real emotions and Technology to interact with each other is so fascinating. To make two opposite world come together through Art and sounds","The project aims to experiment with the technology and the human. A set of question will be provided with the color sheets at the time of the exhibiton Open and fun Questions regarding Gender, hobbies etc. (these sheets will be collected later). With the Color paper and instruction the audience will interact with the machine where we may get some unique observations. To try and understand that the choices we all make are not always on the basis of our Gender. the responses of these questions and observations will provide me  with Data and information for my research.
Simple question such as why we define anything with female, male oriented gender. Is it purely because of the sexual organs or how does it extend to other interpretations like the moon is a female and the sun a male. In abstraction the dot interprets as fertility and a line as phallus etc. there are so many ways to understand what is gender. Maybe it’s the emotion, or the mental state which are again different from any two individuals. 
The sound and movement of the body is surprisingly an interesting way to observe the idea of gender. because its about the movement I want to use the technology to map the movement and the outer form. The idea here is to have the audiences experience something which a technology cant , but use the technology to play around the experiences
","All of my Artworks give birth from my drawings, sketchings, writings and melodies. I love involving the human form in my Artwork. To include Sounds or music, adds up to the overall experiences triggering all the senses.
All of my art works focuses on the psychological understanding of the Gender. The idea of every individual including myself has both the Female and Male qualities. I use my Art or sounds to express the dual nature of an individual. As you can see in my previous Sculptures much of the attention is given to the sexuality and mental health subjects. These I try to translate it in my art to express rebirth, life and death. Sometimes through the discarded/ found materials or though forms It is in my greatest interest to utilize Technology to welcome the audiences to engage, participate and unite together with our diversity. And that’s where Movements of the body or the collective voice come in play, no gender but a collective Voice.

Barabar (Bhawna & Rubina),"“As I entered Rohit’s car for a highly anticipated first date, I couldn’t have imagined what would come next. Within the next half an hour, Rohit moved from holding my hand consensually to sexually assaulting me. I was left numb and overwhelmed with what was happening. Victim-blaming myself even while the assault was happening, the night ended with me kissing him goodbye and asking him to call me later. I ended up dating him for six more months before he unceremoniously dumped me. 
I have never had the courage to bring this story to life. I know for a fact, that the moment I share this publically, I will face a barrage of not just victim blaming but also post assault analysis. Why did I keep sitting in his car even after the rape? Why did I take his calls? Why did I see him again? Why didn’t I report the incident? How could I live with myself after this happened? How could I possibly find reasons to smile, and laugh, and love, and live again?” - Rubina 

Survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) are often berated and humiliated by family, friends, law enforcement and even random strangers. Survivors are often expected to look and behave according to certain unattainable brahminical patriarchal standards in line with the notional idea of a Sita-like ‘perfect victim’ for their experience to be validated. The onus is always on the survivor to prove the seriousness of the assault, with disproportionate emphasis on the survivor’s life, identities, and decisions taken before, during and after the assault.. 

WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN? 
During and post-trauma responses vary from person to person. This is suggested not only by our lived experiences but also suggested by preliminary research. Shelley E. Taylor emphasises that the ‘fight or flight’ trauma response theory was developed only after documenting the behaviour of men post trauma. Women behave very differently during and post trauma which goes way beyond fight or flight which include: fight, flight, freeze, appease, tend, befriend. Stressing on the fact that we don’t certainly know whether this behaviour is biological or a product of social conditioning, she calls for a rehaul of structural understanding of post-trauma behaviour in survivors. 

Our witnessing of the behaviour of the survivor also occurs through the lens of pop culture. And in pop culture, the idea of the perfect victim is reiterated and glorified and the same is expected from the survivors in real life situations. From the attack/incident to coming to terms with, sharing with friends and family, complaining, police report, appearance in court, survivors are supposed to meet a standard of behavior considered proper by the society. The survivor’s reaction during and after the incident is perceived as proof of consent to invalidate the assault and shame the survivors. 

WHAT DO WE PROPOSE?
Triggered by our own experiences of dealing with the perfect victim myth, and with the recent comments from a judicial officer in the Tarun Tejpal case, we wanted to open up this conversation with more survivors. Our project, IMperfect Survivors, aims to document and depict various ways of responding to GBV through visual and audio-visual mixed media art form. IMperfect Survivors aims to provide a safe space for survivors to share their stories and find solidarity among themselves while drawing strength from it. To share their experiences with each other and with the larger world is to reclaim control of the narrative that has long been controlled by the perpetrators. By bringing out these stories we hope to change the way people think about the post-assault behaviour of the survivor. These stories offer living breathing testimonies which present themselves as resistance to the brahmanical-patriarchal structures. 

IMperfect Survivors will collectivise and archive these stories to make a shared artistic portrayal of the survivor’s perspective of post-assault behaviour. The project will also invite co-created artistic responses to these stories. The interpretation of these collective stories through art can evoke affective empathy in the audience and hold a mirror in front of the individual and in extension, the society. When one is confronted with their own flawed beliefs and long-held stereotypes that are actively harming the society, it makes one think. It triggers a change. And through this art, perhaps, we can start a conversation about building a radical, feminist future which is compassionate and intersectional in its existence. ","One of the most critical ways to break the perfect victim fallacy is to listen to, engage with, and share the real lived experiences of women, trans and queer folks in the aftermath of sexual assault. Given the realities of the pandemic as well as embracing the gathering of the internet, IMperfect Survivors will be designed to offer digital space for the testimonies of survivors about their experiences in the aftermath of sexual assault. 

The project will take shape through three key phases centered in the digital realm: 
Phase 1: Holding Space 
In the first phase of the project, we will reach out to Survivors and invite them to share their aftermath stories with us. This will be done through a mix of social media campaigning, connecting with women and trans and queer community networks, as well as personal interactions. We hope to hold space for these powerful narratives and keep open ears and open hearts for each offering. One of the first iteration of one of the outreach methods through a google form is available here (March 2021). 

Phase 2: Building Space  
In the second phase of the project, we would like to build a space for solidarity and connection through art. Art has an intrinsic power to reflect and connect in a way that no other practice can. Using various forms of art, the project will build an open digital space made with care and compassion,  where these stories find an audience ready to offer empathetic, deep listening. 
At this time, we will deeply engage and connect with each story through our chosen artistic mediums - a mix of textile and digital art. We would also invite other artists and performers to engage using their artistic medium with a chosen story (whether their own or someone else’s). We will also create an interactive, digital audio visual work which strings together the various artworks emerging from this process. 
Story owners may be involved in the artistic process, if they so choose, and all stories and artworks will only be shared publicly with the consent of all co-creators.   

Phase 3: Taking up Space 
While it is critical to hear and reflect on these stories, it is as critical to take up space and ensure that these stories are heard loud and clear. These co-created artworks and stories will be hosted on a blog as well as on social media. While the project currently envisions sharing on online platforms, we would eventually like to take these stories to different physical spaces and geographical locations and take up space in all those spaces where women, trans and queer folks have been systematically removed every time they broke out of the ‘perfect victim’ mould.  

","Research costs (internet, phone calls, subscription to journals, etc.): 5,000 
Materials including art supplies, stitching supplies, stationery, software subscriptions (for core artists at Barabar): 5,000 - 8,000
Collaborator fees (artist fees * 10 artists): 30,000 - 40,000
Website hosting (Rs. 3,000 * 5 years): 15,000
Website design: 10,000
Proposed Budget: INR 65,000 - 78,000   
","Barabar is a social design and art collaborative born out of Bhawna and Rubina’s passion to decolonise design and use art as a tool for social justice and liberation. In an attempt to bring deep listening and compassion to their work, Barabar also gives Rubina and Bhawna a brave space to unlearn and challenge their own worldviews, as they recognize their own roles in these exclusionary systems. In their collective and individual capacities, they have experimented with speculative futures through art and design. Their work is reflective of a deep engagement with the socio-political and cultural questions of our time.
","IMperfect Survivors is a response to our gendered existence in a brahminical, patriarchal world. Both of us identify as women and are survivors of sexual assault who have struggled with being IMperfect survivors and thus this project carries a deep personal meaning for us. Women, queer folks, trans folks, and gender minorities are often at the recieving end of a disproportionate amount of violence and our gender identities and gendered presence are one of the most significant reasons for this. And it is this very reason that makes it so difficult for survivors to receive care and compassion after trauma rather than ridicule and gaslighting.  

Through IMperfect Survivors, we want to challenge the impact of brahmanical patriarchy on the notions of justice for survivors of GBV. We want this project to break through gendered perceptions of victims and survivors and thrivers. Through the power of stories, we want to take up the space we rightfully own and embrace our collective survivorship. 
","Bhawna Parmar, pronouns she/her, is a design researcher and an artist trying to find meaning at the intersections of art, co-design and social justice. She is a believer of gender justice and pluralism and is a staunch advocate of creative arts in education. Convinced that fiction can help us imagine a better world than the one we currently inhabit, she loves to research and work in the area of speculative fiction. 

Rubina Singh, pronouns she/her, is a social designer, activist, and embroidery artist. She is trained in law as well as design, which shaped her journey in rights-based social justice work for the last ten years. Her body of work encompasses a range of experiences with international bodies like UNDP and the Commonwealth Secretariat to grassroots gender and youth rights organizations. Her present practice as the co-founder of Barabar, allows her to joyfully explore the intersection of design, embroidery art, and justice.  

Coming together after completing a Masters in Social Design from Ambedkar University Delhi, we (Bhawna and Rubina) set up Barabar. Barabar is an attempt to make our shared vision for social justice a reality. Together, we are working on a range of projects which examine various intersections of justice. For example, we are currently part of the Excavations Cohort at the Med Lab, University of Colorado Boulder, where we are co-creating a speculative fiction project at the intersections of art, tech, and social justice. The project titled, The Right Market, speculates a future era (Digicene) where human rights are bought and sold openly through digital markets.

Our other projects include an in-progress graphic novel examining the fictional world of a Fabrication Department worker, created with the support of Sarnath Banerjee and the Kochi Biennale Foundation (2020). Some of our individual and collective projects are shared in the attached portfolio.

Eeshita Kapadiya,"
Have you ever wondered:
Who fed you? 
Who nurtured you? 
What are your stories of food, labour and care?

In 2020, my mother-in-law and I asked these questions to each other, starting a thread of email exchanges where we shared stories of our upbringing, our relationships and the food we grew up eating. In food and cooking, we found a space for connection, to get to know each other and to allay the intergenerational fears that came with our relationship. This was a beginning; an opportunity to create our own memories and narratives in a reality that normalised the belief that “women are women’s worst enemies”. With conversations around cooking as the starting point, the kitchen became a space for gathering, remembering and storytelling.

We wondered what would happen if we asked women we knew to share their stories of food, labour and care - with women, caregivers they knew, who represented to them a beacon of support, wisdom and solidarity? The result was a budding network of women, caregivers, mothers, sisters, friends, mentors, strangers exchanging letters and recipes of gratitude, friendship and solidarity. Inspired by the writing of Sara Ahmed on her blog Feminist Killjoys, we call this network the Killjoy Cooking Network. We are Killjoys because our memories of sustenance, love and care are often accompanied by memories of trauma, anger and grief. These memories have been passed down from generation to generation, woman to woman, through word-of-mouth, kitchen banter and cautionary tales. The recipes exchanged represent the memories of our relationships, our kitchens and our solidarity to one another.

Since June 2021, the network has gathered more than 20 incredible recipes and letters. These recipes are not only cultural artefacts but also memory-laden inheritance passed down from generations of women, both family and domestic workers, to one another. These recipes were gathered through the simple act of letter-writing, exchanged over email and WhatsApp chats. 

For Gender Bender 2021, we propose to make a digital cookbook called ‘Recipes to Kill For’ (working title). The cookbook will transport people into a multi-layered web portal giving access to the recipes from the Killjoy Cooking Network. The digital cookbook is a metaphor for the hidden ways in which capitalist, patriarchal systems invisibilise women, domestic workers, caregivers and their labour. 

","The cookbook will be a shifting online space that offers recipes, stories and provocations the deeper you go. Using audio, video, image and textual prompts hidden within the recipes, the visitor can access the recipes in the digital space and decode them to reveal texts and letters that question the patriarchal roots of domestic care. 

The web cookbook/portal will include:

1. Recipes: The cookbook will feature 10 recipes that have been gathered through the ongoing letter writing project, Killjoy Cooking Letter Exchange, in which women were asked to send recipes and food stories to each other. The recipes are a part of a growing repository of letters that record memories, recipes and an invisible network of feminist friendships, relationships and care. The cookbook encourages readers to try out these recipes in their own kitchens, but also include hidden messages that can be decoded. Upon decoding these recipes, they will lead to prompts and an invitation to the next action: 

2. Letter writing prompts: Once the recipes are decoded, the portal invites those who have entered to ask themselves: 'Who fed you? What is your story of food, labour and care?' Here, it will hold a space for guided letter writing. Visitors to the portal can refer to the hidden prompts and write letters, emails, and exchange recipes with women, caregivers, friends, mentors, sisters or strangers, anyone who represents to them a beacon of wisdom and solidarity. They can either send the emails they write to the women they have addressed them to and also send them to the Killjoy Cooking Network, adding to the growing repository of recipes. The guided letter writing could also be facilitated through a pre-recorded video embedded in the cookbook.

3. The Killjoy Cooks Kitchen Manifesto: The cookbook also works as a space to create a manifesto for the feminist at home. The manifesto may shape a collective intention to remember and honor the care, sustenance and solidarity we have recieved and continue to recieve in our feminist relationships. It will invite visitors to respond to a question posed by the cookbook and share it in real time.

","I am an artist and designer based in Bangalore interested in questions of gender, care, food and domesticity. As an artist my practice is rooted in the feminist ethos of learning with community, through collaboration. In 2020, I initiated the Killjoy Cooking Network with my collaborator, my mother-in-law, Mrinalini Sebastian. The network is an experiment to document the lived experiences of women through the exchange of recipes and food stories. I also work with social enterprises and a feminist collective in shifting capacities. 


","The relationship between cooking, the kitchen and women is an old one. Cooking for women can be a joy, labour, work, a chore and much more. When we remember the dishes our mothers made, we remember them with fondness. We are also reminded of the kitchen banter or ‘gappa’, ‘gupshup’, the exchange of ‘kitchen secrets’, or complaints of aching legs, of aching hearts, of busy bodies and broken dreams. 

To document is a feminist act. The Killjoy Cooking Letter Exchange is a call for documentation through the act of writing letters and exchanging recipes, to make visible a network of communication between women that is often subliminal, subversive and oral. These recipes and letters have the potential to document the countless hours, dreams and aspirations that are invisiblised by patriarchal expectations of duty and care. It also seeks to offer a space for gentleness, for slowness, for thought and reflection - to be kind to ourselves while we build the capacity to tell our own stories. 

Can these recipes represent the memories of the women who stood in those kitchens, who stand before us today? Can these recipes represent our legacies? Can they represent our relationships with one another? Can a recipe, the language of food, then become our language of resistance, resilience and solidarity?
","In 2017, I began speaking with homemakers, women, about their experience as primary caregivers in patriarchal family structures. The Homemaker’s Kit was one such artefact I imagined in response to these conversations. The Homemaker’s Kit is a metaphorical tool kit consisting of a cookbook, knife, magnifying glass and light. The cookbook holds 6 recipes with hidden provocations that, once decoded, make the ‘user’ question their ideas of domesticity, care and duty. In 2021, I brought these questions into my own home and initiated the Killjoy Cooking Network with my collaborator, my mother-in-law, Mrinalini Sebastian. Killjoy Cooking Network is a budding network of women across the world exchanging letters, recipes and memories of food, labour and care. The network made its debut in 2021, in a written piece and an interactive kitchen that shared recipes and snippets of conversations between my mother-in-law and I for the online magazine, COMPOST. 

Over the last 4 years, I have been working as a community coordinator at a feminist NGO based in Bangalore, Blank Noise. I worked closely with the director, also a public art practitioner, in designing and implementing strategies and interventions to build community led research and raise consciousness towards ending violence against women. Since 2016, I have been a part of a trans-disciplinary research as a research coordinator for oral history and community-led archiving projects.

Sudhamshu Mitra,"Swipe, like, possibly double tap and slide into their DM. Our love languages have gladly accepted these terms as the most common ways of interacting with potential lovers or sexual partners. For a dating app user in the metropolis, the options seem endless, as we scroll with our fingertips through profiles of varied kinds, pausing at what catches our eye. 

Dating applications, unlike matrimonial websites, never ask users to make explicit their caste but allows us to describe ourselves through our quirks, our interests, our aspirations. In this space, our social categories ought not to matter. We become what critical feminist and anti caste discourses have critiqued as the seemingly universal, liberal subject. And here, the modern upper caste subject who, as Ramesh Bairy (1) writes, has attempted to constantly keep one’s caste-self under erasure, enters a world of romantic and sexual possibilities that is supposedly free of caste. In an urban India that is beginning to look sex-positive owing to public debates on sexual politics by different quarters through contemporary history (2), these dating platforms offer a way of shedding the traditional, the regressive. 

As heterosexual savarna subjects in the city, navigating romance and sexuality from our different locations of Information Technology, (particularly gaming) and academia (particularly the field of gender and sexuality) we are intrigued by the potentials of technology in bringing us in ‘touch’ with others. This project is interested in mapping the experience of users of digital dating applications to understand how we make alliances in the modern context. While using insights from digital ethnographic works from around the world (3), we focus on the city of Bangalore in creating a digital art installation that is in large part dynamic. We hope to have audiences engage with their own physical experience of ‘seeing’ and presenting oneself through image and the written word, their choices and preferences. 

Different scholars from varied traditions have worked on issues of caste, desire and alliance. Nidhin Donald (4) writes of the shared physical location that is central to falling in love and in transgressing sexual boundaries. Yet other sociological work in India and Western contexts has focused on how marriage alliances are governed by shared culture and ‘code of conduct’ (5). Christina Dhanraj (6) and Akhil Kang (7) have written on the experiences of dating and desirability in relation to marginalized caste identities/ locations. Following these insights, our project comments on desirability and attraction that may be working within a “social regulation of sexual touch” as Ambedkar writes (8). 

Caste or what Aniket Jaaware (9) calls the ‘regime of touch’ may not be transforming with the use of dating apps that do have the potential of letting us come in contact with everyone we ‘see’ on the app. But what are the specific modes we can observe in our own navigation of these apps? How are we reinventing a heteronormative, brahmanical order in  delimiting who we come ‘in touch with’? These are some of the questions the project will address.

","An attempt in digital ethnography, the project will work with consenting participants to create a repository of dating profiles. While this repository gives us a foundation to work through the idea of caste and digital dating platforms, the project will culminate in a dynamic mobile/web interface for more users or audiences of Gender Bender. Through these interactions, we hope that the unspoken caste-markers that colour our swipes and conversations on and through dating apps no longer remain unspoken. 

More specifically: the interface would be similar to a dating app where the user chooses their interests, and constructs their profile. The user is then shown a list of anonymous profiles to match with alongside a hidden compatibility score with each profile varying in vocabulary, stylizations in typing and lingo, and in the contents in photographs, to choose from. At this point, the user may be asked to forego/change parameters in their profile such as their education level, language preferences, the kind of cultural material they grew up with such as TV shows, books, and the places they have traveled to. This inevitably affects their compatibility score on our interface, reflecting how one’s cultural and social capital based on their caste location shapes the kind of people they come in touch with, whether online or offline. Another quirk we hope to bring into this experience is the flipside to seemingly neutral questions that one poses to their potential date. “Where are you originally from?”, “What kind of music do you listen to?”, “What are your favourite eateries?”, “What kind of conspiracy theories do you believe in?” and so on would be rephrased to reveal the underlying investment in the other’s caste that makes up these questions.

Similar to the ones mentioned above, at every step in the interface we will have different sensorial (visual/textual/auditory and tactile) feedback to the users’ responses to questions or prompts. This allows for bringing focused attention to the ways in which caste location shapes conversations, likes and dislikes, and essentially, choice -- disrupting the idea of a castelessness that surrounds the dating space.

Scholars, activists and artists alike have explored and questioned the workings of oppressive structures in keeping power relations firmly in place. 

In the context of Indian caste society, Ambedkar (1) states that women are the gateways to caste, theorizing the origin of caste as the origin of “the mechanism of endogamy”. Caste successfully becomes an “enclosed class” by the control and regulation of women’s sexuality. Further, we can turn to Uma Chakravarti (2) who writes of the ideological control that scriptures instill over women to maintain patrilineal succession as well as caste purity. In her work we find illustrations of women willingly participating in the practice of caste because of the strong ideological basis of its material reality. 

Our micropolitics and everyday practices, whether conscious or not, lead to the strengthening of the connection between gender and caste. At the same time, we hold the possibility of altering this interlinkage, or what Judith Butler (3) calls the heteronormative matrix, through big and small negotiations. In this project, we are also interested in finding these negotiations by participants that may be challenging gender and caste norms.

Komal Jain,"We propose to build Gender Bender Town - a virtual social space on Gather.Town (https://www.gather.town/) co-created with queer* people.

The Context: Dominant binary social and cultural notions of gender identity and expression are carried to the digital world through the creators and users of digital platforms. Virtual social spaces like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc fail queer individuals by having inadequate measures for privacy that jeopardise their safety and engage with limited forms of expression. (For example, the AI on Instagram pushes heteronormative content making it difficult for queer content to be part of the mainstream. It also has vague guidelines for content under the nebulous label of “sexually suggestive”. Human content moderators training the system to identify posts that supposedly come in this category have widely different ideas of what exactly the term can mean, making their bias the norm for the platform) 

With GBT, we hope to revisit the idea of social media by reflecting upon the qualities of safe queer social spaces from real life and how those could be translated to the virtual world in a fun, interactive manner. We envision a participatory project wherein we design the space with queer people.

Process: We will organise 7 participatory design sessions of 2-3 hours each with queer individuals to think, develop and co-create features (assets, rooms, interactions) of the social media platform. As we move forward with the sessions, new participants will be adding to the work done in previous ones. We propose hosting the final participatory design session during the Festival and then opening the final platform for visitors. 

*We see queerness as people who self-identify with the label, people who are questioning, and even people who do not wish to be defined or categorised, but nonetheless do not conform to the normative ideas of gender and sexuality. ","Gather.Town is a video conferencing tool / website with added features to make custom interactions, virtual rooms and media assets providing a perception of private / public real-life spaces.

In this project, we will explore world building and asset (images, videos) creation tools on Gather.town to create virtual social spaces. This project is in the conceptualisation stage. We will design workshops and organise 7 sessions of 2 to 3 hours each to work with the participants on thinking, developing and creating elements (assets like images, videos; social rooms, interactions) of the social media platform. Depending on what participants wish to create, the outcomes - including rooms, aesthetics, interactions, guidelines - could either range from creating a community wardrobe to virtual libraries or bars, etc. We would like the participants to dig deeper into their imagination while tempering it to real life social interactions and communities.

As we move forward with the sessions, new participants will be adding to the work done in previous ones. The outcome including reflections and questions will be exhibited at the Gender Bender Festival.

Risk (R) and contingency (C)
R1 - People might not have devices that run the website properly
C1 - The gather.town platform can be integrated with zoom and google documents. In the workshops structure, we will integrate communication with the participants through zoom to vocally / textually (chat) share ideas

R2. The extensive research and participatory sessions alter and widen our initial hypothesis and add more narratives to it.
C2: A mission statement with a wider perspective and flexibility to accommodate artistic research will guide us in taking directions that align with our core values and edit out the things that don’t. Keeping that in mind, newer narratives that support our values would strengthen the concepts.","Research - 4,000*2 people = 8,000

[Portfolio- www.komalja.in (updated May 2020)]","Gendered spaces are areas in which particular genders of people, and particular types of gender expression, are considered welcome or appropriate, and other types are unwelcome or inappropriate. For example, public spaces are cis-hetero male dominated while private spaces like kitchens are considered to be feminine spaces. Most physical spaces reflect and reproduce this hegemonic heteronormativity, also creating public-private divide, and the same is being passed onto digital spaces.

AI on social media platforms pushes heteronormative content and a lack of moderation along with selective exposure subjects queer individuals to feeling excluded/rejected. Lack of provisions for adequate privacy often lead to harassment, and unwanted intrusion on their private lives. Advertisements on social media are also significant sources of gender stereotyping. These problems hinder people from freely expressing themselves and engaging with each other socially, creating digital spaces that are equivalent to closets. 

The online world can be a space with liberating potential where gender can be performed in new ways- perhaps also inspire how our physical social worlds can be more inclusive. By exploring a social media platform (without commercials) that is created by the audience, for the audience, we believe, we would be able to give power to people to create online spaces to start conversations, share ideas and interests and build communities that are inclusive of gender expressions and identities.","Bhavika- I am a designer and engineer interested in critically analysing technologies using participatory and speculative methodologies.

Twisha Mehta,"Genre, Art as a means to make abstractness and fluidity a comfortable reality.
What is Genre
A creative digital space dedicated to understanding the genre behind one’s “top listened to songs”. This interactive space is created to provide information on the intersection of musical genres that the song can be identified under, visualising where their musical choice lies on an extensive spectrum of niche as well as well known genres.
It will inform them of how their songs mingle with various other genres, each of them much less rigidly categorised than they would have originally believed. Alongside this, it will also provide them with origin stories of these genres, to suggest how these labels cannot be institutionalised (and are a product of cultural evolution), as an example, how hip-hop was not considered music by many three decades ago, and still isn’t by some. 
Through this analogy, any given user’s own understanding of genres is deconstructed and reframed, showcasing how fluid and non-confirmative labels really are. It’s harder than ever to classify a song into just one “pure” category, and its genre lies within the intersection of a multitude of influences and histories that one may never have imagined leading to the creation of sub-genres often as a result of countercultures.
Now, what does this have to do with bending gender?
At this point it is worthy to note that the English word ‘Gender’, translates to ‘Genre’ in French and that is precisely the subtext that we are hinting at when this process begins. As the viewer’s journey progresses through this interactive website, the piece shifts its focus away from music to become a conversation about gender. To reiterate, the point of our exhibit is to make one question the double standards that exist in our understanding of constructed labels, and categories. 
Music is a rather universally loved artform, and it’s hard to come across people who do not enjoy music whatsoever. To start this conversation using a metaphor of an artform almost everyone would be able to relate to, would allow us to hold a conversation with a wide variety of people. Then, when the underlying gender subtext is introduced, we hope that exposure to the former music narrative would make them more accepting or stimulated to learn more about the same in terms of gender, this is an application of a concept called ‘entropy and redundancy’ in communication theory. To understand that just as each note, each beat, each time signature, and each instrument choice makes an individual song different from any other when it comes to genre, so does every person's unique traits put them somewhere in a much larger spectrum.
The medium that is planned to be used to accomplish this is that of a website, with more details about the process provided below. 
What digital mediums bring to us,  is a golden opportunity to widen our reach. We hope to create a website that allows for people to make a personal connection to our subject. As proposed we want to use music as a vehicle to drive our conversation forward and connect with users with varying degrees of familiarity with the subject at hand.
","Our piece, in the medium of a website, allows an audience to pick a song which we run through Spotify's database to pull information about the 5600 genres they have listed. Following which we present the user with an interactive visualization and bifurcation of genres. Here the narrative drives us forward and brings impactful connection to the gender discourse. Having begun the conversation we afford the user a moment to explore genres through a lens of genders interactively by displaying a 2D colour spectrum that responds to your cursor's position to play little snippets of music across these genres for the user at their own discretion to draw differences and parallels. At the end of this exploration we leave the user with an insight of the french counterpart of the word “genre” and perhaps leave them with more questions than we have posed.
One of the key abilities of digital spaces is to reach out to people across borders, beyond geographical communities. And as Gender Bender is digital for the first time, our piece takes  advantage of the medium's ability to access a far greater number of people than a physical festival ever can, connecting them over an irrefutable topic such as music. The musical narrative that we choose to express ourselves with, is also easily exhibited by a digital space and this influences the scalability of our piece.
This project allows for an entry point to anybody (with an internet connection), even those not actively involved in the gender discourse to engage with concepts of abstraction, fluidity and spectrums through the metaphor of musical categories.
We leverage the feature of personalisation that digital spaces provide us with, to create capabilities for our audience to question their own personal narratives, providing them with different results each time. Another way we effectively navigate these spaces is by capitalising on one of its greatest strengths – its ability to engage with non-linear storytelling techniques. We enable our audience to choose their own unique experience while interacting with our piece, ensuring that they would reach their own subjective end to it. This non-linear storytelling and availability of endless choice puts the conclusion as a subject to the discretion of the audience.
By leveraging the aesthetic flexibility of digital spaces, we will incentivise the shareability of our piece. Shareability is a key point in our project, and ensuring it through the use of a digital space would help tremendously in furthering the gender discourse.
Finally, creating within the digital space, allows us as creators to be mindful of accessibility from the very beginning and not as an afterthought. Creating for a range of devices and even low bandwidths helps make the conversation of fluidity more ubiquitous

This collective has focused on collaborating with healthcare experts, scholars in gender studies for public messaging especially in regional languages, creation of detailed indie publication projects, and projects often with a focus on forms of storytelling involving technology and upcoming mediums and tools like Augmented reality, Generative design, and so on. Our collaboration is built upon bringing together our own individual skill-sets, and combining them to create much better outputs than we could make by ourselves. We are driven by our common beliefs, interests and perceptions. We collaborate with various different specialists when faced with a project which might need additional input, to make sure the final output is as stellar as possible. As a collective, we are all heavily drawn to different works of art, such as music and visual arts, and we try to explore, understand, and take inspiration from them in our different endeavours.","By using parallels between musical genres and gender, this project aims to normalize the notion that every human lies on a spectrum, whether in terms of their sexuality or their gender, mood or preference. Set compartments and expected behaviors are a myth, and can be pointed out to be the cause behind a great many social problems today. Just as musical genres are diverse and defy categorization when looked at closely, so does gender, a concept much more complex than the binary or even “trinary” ideals that we have been taught. Through the narrative of music, we wish to introduce and discuss these ideas in an unique, approachable, and sensational way. Our intention is to alter mindsets by taking users through this journey. Furthermore, the website’s ability to analyse music and offer interesting information on them can make it very shareable across people, thereby helping it spread across many people.","As mentioned previously, our works, whether individually or as a collective, have focused extensively on art, technology, and different cultural and social aspects.

Aswaty George and Sreelekshmi,"‘Queering the Gaze’:
When both of us (Sreelekshmi and Aswaty) met in August this year in Sreelekshmi’s house in Kerala, the sense of longing that we both had felt during the entire Covid-19 pandemic chaos and lockdown seemed to have met with hope. There was a tremendous sense of belongingness and comfort that we felt in finally getting to share our stories of having been touched wrongly by different men at different points in our lives. Not that our paths hadn’t crossed each other’s on different occasions prior to this but we never got the chance to exchange our notes on our experiences with sexual assault and molestation, the trauma caused therefore, and our trysts with dealing with this trauma consciously and sub-consciously. When our days together were about to come to a close we thought of moving together to this Spanish song ‘No me Toques Mal’ which translates to ‘Don’t touch me wrong’. The song is sung by artists ‘La Muchacha’ and ‘La Otra’ (here’s the link to this beautiful and powerful song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHSY-7Rykl4). The idea of moving together to the said song was to see how two female bodies can offer comfort and solidarity to each other when they have both been violated by men in their lives in the past. It is this movement sequence (attached in the last response on the google form) that we want to explore further for our project submission for Gender Bender, 2021.  
The project focusses on the notions of intimacy and communication between two ‘women’. It focusses on queering the gaze. How do they move together or find their ways to move with or without the other body and more importantly why do they choose to come together and move are some of the thoughts we would like to delve deep into. Whether the feelings that project from these two bodies for the reasons of solidarity, shame, anger, desire, or is it a feeling which is unknown to both of them? The two bodies learn and initiate their ways into the other, communicating in their own manners, finding comfort somewhere in this process of movement. The project also questions if this comfort of two women being intimate, is what one usually is exposed to in the society, in popular media. Does this fact affect the women in initially having hesitations to move, are they still in the ‘discovery’ phase of navigating their ways to understand their own and the other’s body? 
We aim to address the concerns of coming together for the purpose of communicating the ‘wrongs’ the society has made them feel about their bodies. Do these bodies also come across the feeling of healing as they hold each others’ bodies or will they be able to hold each others’ bodies is something we would like to explore through movement and dance? The space we would dance at, as part of this project, would be a space that the bodies have felt ‘unsafe’ at, which is pretty much all those nooks and corners of the towns. This could be an unlit corner of the street, a footpath, a bus stop, a tea stall in the corner of the street or anywhere that women feel unsafe in the town. Even in meeting and initiating a movement in one of those nooks, there is an expected solidarity and strength the bodies find in each other. The movement that we are submitting was done inside the comfort of the four walls of our room. But will these movements address the nooks in the bodies, those corners which were damaged in the bodies to unveil something larger and if so, how will the movements navigate the space and what could we do with the societal gaze, is something we would like to gauge from these moving bodies? 
As we closed our performance on ‘No me toques mal’ for the night and moved to the next day, we also started noticing male privilege around us very keenly. We went to a shop to buy some snacks during the day when a group of young boys came to the shop to purchase some cigarettes. They ogled at both of us up and down, uttered loudly to the shopkeeper which brand of cigarettes they wanted and left ravaging on their bikes. We, however, felt safe in each other’s company. It felt disappointing that men have the privilege of doing what they like but at the same time, two women’s companionship seemed a threat to this privilege.
 
","The camera’s movements will play a key role in the navigation of our performance project. We hope to use the movements of the camera in queering the audience’s gaze. In order to queer the gaze, the camera will be used to focus on parts of the body that are uncomfortable to be watched by the audience. The two female bodies, the performers’ bodies will also be seen as one unit at certain points through the movement and the parts of this unit that are discomforting for the male gaze will be accentuated by the camera. In this discomfort, we as artists hope to find comfort and in doing so we also hope to transcend some of this comfort to everybody standing against Patriarchy.     
While addressing the digital space and the audience, the audience would become the performers who would move with us, through what the camera’s gaze would project in the performance piece. Camera’s gaze initially following is almost like a stalker and our bodies  being that of the threatened space, slowly developing solidarity with each other's bodies to finally make the camera gaze uncomfortable with the solidarity or intimacy or desire that builds up. The gaze finally finds comfort in seeing the solidarity or does it? Is yet to be explored. We would also be using lights for effective storytelling and of course the sounds and noises of the space would stay natural to the roads.
The camera will also be used such that the two bodies interchangeably come and go outside of the frame from time to time as is shown in one of the videos uploaded in this submission. This is in the hope that we are able to navigate the differences in the audience’s mood when they view the two bodies together versus when they get to view only one body at a time.  
We also look into the medium of the phone as it becomes the camera, a weapon also used for surveillance on the body of a woman. At different points through the performance we will be looking into the camera in an attempt to warn it against viewing us wrongly. Technology and its functioning has had a very male dominant gaze. We hope to challenge this gaze of surveillance through our movement by taking away the camera from the cinematographer and viewing each other’s damaged parts through our own gaze of solidarity and care.

She continues to grapple with developing this module through an embodied pedagogy of dance and movement. 
","Performativity of gender exists in our everyday beings. Our project approaches this space in the simple act of coming together of two ‘female’ bodies. The project focuses on the idea of space which defines how gender is performed in the bodies. In a shady street, where fear is habituated in the body, the bodies revive certain movements. We are not to touch each other, we feel uneasy to touch or to be touched or held with care. How do we come to the idea of safety and care perhaps a feeling for the first time, through which the bodies process damage and healing?  
We would also like to explore how our queer performance makes the camera lens feel uncomfortable. ‘Queering the Gaze’ is the central theme of our project. We would like to distort the male gaze and explore the queer gaze. “Why does the audience feel uncomfortable watching two female bodies come together? Is it because we are not used to two female bodies being intimate with each other on camera? Does that make it “queer” or “strange” for us?”...are some questions we are asking with our performance.
“No me toques mal!”- Is my questioning of your male privilege making you feel uncomfortable? In your male gaze, is my queerness damaging to you? Our performance is also a warning to patriarchy which enables men to touch women wrongly. It is a cry, “ You let me live the way I want to and don’t ever touch me wrong!” 
","The concept note also covers the common areas of interest of both Aswaty and Sreelekshmi. 
Sreelekshmi has been exploring the form of mohiniyattam to question the gender performativity, narratives and patriarchal ‘classicalised’ gaze in the form. Body is a major conflict area she tries to converse with, in performances. Feminism, mental health and dance education are her areas of interest. She is a performance studies practitioner and researcher and is looking forward to carrying her practice of dance as one of research to unlearn, learn and create an embodied practice. She has performed at various dance festivals and recently screened her performance art at KCC’s ‘Beyond Binaries’. Her few articles on dance have also been published. 
Aswaty has been interested in questioning the body’s restrictions that come from a poor mental health status. She has also been keen on finding meaning of the secular through her dance. She has done pieces on Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s ‘Hum Dekhenge’ and its Tamil translation to understand the politics of the secular in the body. She is also interested in a contemporary dance form called Prime Movers, which is an investigation developed by artist Joshua Sailo under whom she is learning the form currently. She also maintains a keen interest in the forms of American hip hop and is currently teaching herself twerking and hip hop.

Suchandra kundu,"Tentative Proposal


                                          Rudrani Dasgupta Chaudhuri
                                                  Suchandra Kundu


Queer lived experiences are varied and variegated. We believe that gender identity and gender expression are constantly in the process of being made and unmade through changing ideas, experiences and perspectives in the lives of queer people. Queer people have complex relationships with public spaces. Most often it is one of danger, violence and discrimination. Cis-heteronormative public spaces violently reject any body with a non-normative gender expression. However, we believe how the queer self forms and performs itself under the public gaze, interacts within various public spaces- formal, institutional, informal, communal, regulatory or liberating, constitute important steps in the journey of queer becoming. Our project will focus on queer presence in public spheres real, virtual and even fantastical.
 Our project will be designed as an interactive graphic narrative on the themes of gender identity, sexuality and gender expression. It will require active participation of the  audience/reader through choices that unfold multiple storylines similar to the format of a choose-your-own-adventure book. Our narrative will therefore try to ‘queer’ the traditional literary genre of the bildungsroman in content and form, through a story of growing up, being and becoming. It will be a part fantasy and part auto-ethnographic exploration of our idea of the queer self. We will draw from our deeply personal experiences, the journey we navigated and survived and our hopes and dreams for alternate realities.
The element of fantasy in our narrative has a very specific symbolic and representative significance. As mentioned earlier, our narrative will be auto-ethnographic and draw heavily from our own lives. It will reflect our own struggles with identity, sexuality, gender expression as well as mental health issues of depression, anxiety, childhood trauma and abuse. The fantasy element of our narrative will be an attempt to represent the psychiatric condition named ‘ Maladaptive Daydreaming’. First identified in 2002 by Professor Eliezier Somer it is a condition characterised by intense daydreaming often triggered by real-life events that acts as an escape or coping mechanism. We intend to translate into our art the experiences of a queer child suspended between hard reality and the safe-space of imagination. Our story of growing-up, being and becoming is also one of healing. We would like to show that in a cis-heteronormative reality where subjecthood is rigidly defined, fantasy and imagination are automatically non-normative and therefore inherently queer.
","Our project will be designed as an interactive graphic narrative. We would like to effectively use the freedom that digital space offers in terms of accessibility and interactiveness. Our project requires the active participation of the  audience/reader to succeed as an immersive experience. Our narrative will unfold through choices based on multiple storylines similar to the format of a choose-your-own-adventure book. The paintings will be hand drawn with the accompanying text superimposed digitally. We would also be experimenting with the use of animation that would be compatible with our overall style and vision.
The story will be divided into chapters or episodes in the life of the protagonist each consisting of events that affect their understanding of gender and sexuality. Each episode will present the audience with choices to move the story forward in different directions. The story will have at least three different endings depending on the choices that the audience makes. For instance, in a scene that depicts the protagonist being bullied in school, the choices may let the protagonist escape in fantasy, run away, or confront their bullies. The digital space will allow us to empower the audience in such a way that they feel a personal investment in our art.
","Stage 1: layout, drawing, making of the physical book
To go forward with the storyline page by page we need basic art materials like various mediums of colours such as acrylic ink, oil pastel, watercolour, brushes, Fabriano paper etc.
 Approx budget : Rs. 5,000-7,000/-
This is going to be a lengthy graphic book as per the pages and the time limit we are going to have. This might have four or five main stories but each story comes with three different outcomes which will make it lengthier. So we are going to hire three to four people for drawing as per the layout so that the final outcome of each page does not miss a beat.
  For 4 main chapters, each story will have at least 3 pages, i.e. a  total of 12 pages.
 Each storyline will have 3 different outcomes, so total 12 outcomes with each covering 2 pages at least, i.e. a total of 24 pages. So the approx numbers of total pages are (main storyline) 12+ 24 (outcome storyline)= 36 pages. 
Rs350 -550 must be allocated to each page.
Approx budget :Rs. 14,000- 20,000 /-
Stage 2: Digitalization.
Each page would be digitalized and set up in the book format.
We will hire technical support to create the basic programming which will allow the audience to choose the outcome they want to have and other functions like going back and forth and wherever viewers want to navigate throughout the graphic book.
Total number of outcomes are 12.  
Approx budget: Rs. 9,000- 13,000/- 
So our total budget is approximately between (minimum) Rs. 5000+14,000+9000=28,000 /- (Twenty eight thousand rupees)  to (maximum) Rs. 7,000+20,000+13,000= 40,000 /- (Forty thousand rupees)","Suchandra Kundu (she/they) is a visual art practitioner. She has earned her MFA degree from Government Art College, Kolkata.  She tries to be as versatile as possible in her paintings, illustratrations, sculptures and performance art. Her art practice revolves around questioning and dissecting the gender binary. Drawing from lived experiences and personal reflections they continuously try to unveil the reality of the world ‘beyond gender binary’. They are very much invested in artistic collaboration with other fellow artists (33/3 Studio and others) and writers of Kolkata. 
Rudrani Dasgupta Chaudhuri (she/her) is a writer and lecturer in English literature at Gobardanga Hindu College. She has earned her Masters degree in English from EFLU, Hyderabad and has qualified UGC-NET and JRF. She is passionate about writing poetry, fiction and the confessional mode of essay. In her writing Rudrani explores questions of gender, sexuality and mental health. 
","Our project attempts to navigate the questions of gender identity and gender expression that we ask ourselves and the answers that we give to ourselves within that elusive human experience called ‘growing up’. We believe that gender is performative and it is always in flux, something to be sought, investigated and created in life and in art. Our project is the story of ‘figuring out gender’ that is deeply personal and at the same time an effort at honest representation of relatable shared experiences. Our project is the story of a non-normative protagonist and their journey through childhood and adolescence wading through gender roles, clothes, names, love, hate, imagination and harsh reality. We believe that the idea of one’s sense of self is intrinsically related to the question of gender. Our story is about finding out the “I am” that exists beyond the male/female binary of social, political, economic and cultural reality around us. 
We believe that interactions in public spaces contribute hugely to the otherisation of the queer child. In our project, that involves interactive storytelling, we would focus on such scenarios in the school, the playground, the everyday public transport as well as virtual spaces where the queer ‘other’ finds oneself defined and placed outside the invisible margin according to the norms of the world they exist in. In contrast to that our story creates spaces of fantasy and imagination that is not only an escape but also a space for self-affirmation and validation. In our project the fluidity of imagination conflates with the fluidity of gender in ‘being’ and ‘doing’ all things odd, weird and gloriously queer. 
","Suchandra Kundu: With my open sexual identity in the house of heterosexual parents and their denial of it, that is the reality of most of the non-binary people,  my practice of visual art deals with this basic right of human existence. My journey captures both the scenarios of the insider and the outsider in the “Dry Blood” series. As an unmarried homosexual neighbor, I am an audience to the polished gossips of the community of housewives and 'aunties' captured is the project  “Not Scared of Ghosts, in works like ‘the uncomfortable lives’, leap of faith, etc.My practice seizes those glimpses of that parallel world where the laborer boys and men living in small factories in my neighbourhood voice their dreams, desires, and coarse gossips in works like ‘Babuji dhire chalna/ Mister be careful’, ‘monkey business’ etc. As a practitioner assigned female, my life did fall into this pattern of binary and through my practice of visual art and living, I am continuously unlearning it. This continuous conflict of imposition of gender roles and the expectations from it is an aid to my visual practice.

Rudrani Dasgupta Chaudhuri: My approach to writing is deeply auto-ethnographic. In my preferred genres of poetry and the personal essay, I draw from self-reflection, personal experience and a very intimate way of philosophising. I write about women loving women,  women desiring women and my pursuit of the elusive ‘femme’ that is beyond binaries. In the poem “In the name of the Mother, the Daughter, and the Holy Fire” I explore  transgressive desires where personal and cultural her-stories are interwoven in a journey of pain, love and evolution. The collaborative project titled “Anturghor (The Birthing Room)” is a celebration of the closet as a space of transformation for the queer self. My writing reflects my own battle with depression, anxiety, trauma and aspires to transform psychological pain into art.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oltWJBKZlbDucZUdcaHZRnEk8wUEpPuf, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VHP4rAkpJaHDDnOJywIyta1ZDLQKl_4E, https://drive.google.com/open?id=12WVma2M4LMZtZ7OCaagAU6yR5-UD4p_X"
Johnson Rajkumar,"Video Archive of Nupi Manbi:
Archives are the keepers of culture and their interpretation of human experience shapes our history and our stories. It exists mostly as a state institution or through the stories of dominant, largely, patriarchal story tellers. These kinds of spaces where histories are constructed have failed to tell the stories of marginalized voices, specifically of gender and sexual identity. Even if these marginalised voices exist in archive, they are told through a dominant and privileged agency. 

The Video Archive of Nupi Manbi will challenged this dominant narrative of Manipur’s society by video documenting Nupi Manbi (Male to Female Transgender) testimonies. Nupi manbi, loosely translated as “being like a woman”, is the current preferred Manipuri term for male-to-female transgender people. The testimonies will be a ruminative visual anthology exploring the Nupi Manbi experience of their identities through mnemonic testimony, observational moments, and fragmentary impressions. 

The video testimonies will create a different or counter-discourses, giving voice and agency to multiple and complex gender experiences. Throughout the testimonies, the project will explore the idea of ‘safe space’, designed to critique patriarchy and capitalist hegemonies. Even as Manipur Nupi Manbi’s history goes back to ancient times, the archive will document only the contemporary history due to the scope of the project. In Manipur, especially in the Imphal valley, majority of the Nupi Mabi are into beauty industry especially in beauty parlour. These beauty parlours are not just a space for their livelihood but it’s a space for young transgender to explore and discover their genders. Most of the young transgender, they run away from home or skip schools as they are constantly harassed, they end up in beauty parlours to get help from their seniors. Eventually learning the craft of beauty industry. 

The Video Archive of Nupi Manbi will document their testimonies of mobility from home to beauty parlours and beauty parlours to other metro cities, so on and so forth. Recently, they have migrated largely to Indian metros, especially Bangalore and New Delhi to search for jobs and seeking refuge in the anonymity of urban cities. 

The project will be an episodic and fragmented conversation that arranges mnemonic testimony, which captures the landscape of disillusionment and hope beneath the facade of ordinary lives of acceptance and normalcy of traumatic past. Through these video testimonies, the project will explore the relationship of video documenting to reconciliation of their past and present. This anthology of video is arranged as thematic chapters of intimate testimonials to observational footage and conversations that reflects the oral tradition surrounding the society of Manipur. The project uses the aesthetic of ambiguity to reflect on the traumas and absurdities of gender norms while trying to avoid trivialization.

Eventually the idea is have shape a repository of narratives, its aim is to enable and further conversations around the history, present, and future of the Manipur’s transgender community.
","I belong to the indigenous people of Manipur, Meitei. I have been associated in story telling of my place and community in some capacity or the other. Being a person from the community itself, it gives me an insight into society to navigate through the projects. Besides my previous work related to transgender communities will help me gain trust and get authentic testimonies. Most of the transgender working in beauty parlours have become friends over the period of time. 

Working through the digital space will open up new avenues for more questions and counter question to the issue of gender. In today’s world, since so much of the public sphere is increasingly mediated in online venues, and since the digital space in particular facilitates the creation of counter-public spaces, the archive is potential diversification of critical practices, some of which may question or even seek to subvert some of the dominant practices of the public sphere. The digital video archive will become an archive of emotion and potentially of trauma reconciliation. In the process, the archive seeks to demonstrate a challenging but productive way to expand the awareness of possibilities in both articulating Nupi Manbi presences in the history and culture and in asserting transgender values. Even as there are multiple avenues in online spaces, the archive will start to document a glimpse of Manipur Nupi Manbi’s history through individually lived experience. But doing so, no matter how provisionally, offers a challenging sense of gender questions in digital spaces.

stuti dalal,"Currently untitled, this multi-media project visually showcases anxieties one experiences as different kinds of identities intersect with one’s identity as a feminist and the mental and emotional labour one performs to reflect upon it. The exhibit opens with a VR interactive panorama painting depicting a ‘Mindscape’ where negotiations of often colliding, competing identities are situated, reclaiming a space for fears, questions, politically incorrect - liminal opinions to reside. The audience navigates such ‘Thought Threads’  in the ‘Mindscape’ by clicking and interacting with the expanding windows that trigger animations and rap verses that depict situational observations and lived experiences. 

Content: (Thought threads)
The following are brief accounts of the predicaments on which rap verses and visuals will be based upon.

1.Bosslady:
My grandfather wished for me a career in teaching. That way I could run the house but also work, be independent and never at the mercy of a man. His intentions were noble but abided by the confines of a patriarchal system. Changing the status quo was beyond his imagination. ‘Boss-lady’ seeks to explore questions like -Who is a boss lady? How does one become a boss lady vs becoming a ‘homemaker’? What enables the making of a boss lady? Is a homemaker a boss lady? Whose work is ‘work’ and whose ‘work’ is not? It reflects on the process of value deeming on kinds of labour that are at the service of capitalism, community and care. When the unit of exchange of labour is money, when independence can be attained only through monetary means, Is a homemaker yet to be liberated from unpaid labour? Are independence and liberation the same thing?


2. Labour
A silent display of images of commissioned Indian Paintings of nobility and aristocratic families and their living spaces which upon clicking expanding a window that reveals the invisible labour of women responsible for the functional and aesthetic upkeep of the sanitized, manicured living spaces and figures. These visuals will be overlaid on the painting itself as if to reveal what was hidden, or absent, or erased or what went on right before the painting was immortalised.


3. Drop me home:
Navigates the anxieties of a person heading home latenight who hesitates in asking for a lift from their male friends, but is fearful of their safety. The lack of safety is a hurtful reminder of what society views as bodily limitations and vulnerability that they wished to be in denial of. Along with reluctance to ask for help, there is an expectation to be understood. On the otherside, some male friends feel compelled to volunteer and oblige out of peer pressure and/or fear of being branded as insensitive or chauvinist even if they do not wish to for a variety of subjective reasons. The result is a dishonesty stemmed by burdens of performativity. How would such a predicament become framed as feminist issue?


3. ‘Raising a woke child’- an observation of an urban, uppercaste, upper class parent’s desire to raise their boy to be a woke child– a sensitive, smart boy that takes an anxious turn.
The parents desire to provide the best exposure to the child – Environmental awareness, tree plantation sprees, to turn off the tap as one lathers the soap, local produce eating and blunt toddler friendly chopping knives that cut big chunk clunks of kheera. To help in the kitchen, learn to enjoy greens over screens, tap dancing class, lie in the grass. Teach - the battle of the sexes is futile, that genders are equal, one chooses their own, that love is love and is no one’s place to diss on. Be okay if the child wants to apply nail polish, 
bask in the compliments of others saying
“MY god, as a boy your child helps in the kitchen, that’s amazing!” 
But they are silently worried when the nail painting becomes too often, and are nervous of the possibility of the tap dance turning into kathak. The compliments once bestowed on the boy loving peeling beans, chopping carrots turns into anxiety. Now exposure efforts include passive attempts of introducing a sport to balance the kathak class begins. Are Liberal values competing with protective parental instinct? Proximity to the unknown? Letting gender shape itself is both at the same time freeing and scary as they imagine the consequences of the child stepping beyond the doors of their home. Raising a ‘woke’ child may be easier in theory than in practice.","FORM:
We intend to use the affordances of desktop VR space to represent the dichotomy created around the competing identities. Immersive VR based interactions and movements will enable the viewer to enter the intimate space of one’s ‘mindscape’ to witness questions and conflicts of lived experience and observations with four in-space augmented interactive overlays based on the four ‘Thought Threads’. Apart from its capabilities to create VR desktop environments, the software ‘MozVR’ affords the embedding of interactive micro-narrative driven worlds of these ‘Thought Threads’. We intend to use these capabilities to make the viewer immerse in negotiations around these competing identities.


Two simplify, There are two key kinds of interactivity in the project:
1. Creation of a 360 degree panorama painting ‘mindscape’ to that is the landing exhibit and VR environment.
2. Clickable buttons of the micro narrative ‘thought threads’ that expand to reveal subjective nuances and complexities and conflicts with by using augmented overlayed video windows that are collapsible. These ‘Thought thread’ windows will open into animations, and rap verses that are overlaid on the paintings seamlessly.

Stuti Dalal is a visual artist, researcher and writer passionate about projects that lie at the intersection of design and society. With a background in visual communication and liberal arts, she enjoys working on projects that involve the application of both these sensibilities. Besides her day job as a freelance designer and writer, she volunteers as a Teacher with Make a Difference. Currently, she is focused on questioning her understanding of the praxis of design, it’s complicity and role in a capitalist world through the lens of the arrival of colonisation and modernity, defuturing, and seeks to understand alternative imaginations of ways of being in the world. Lately, she is questioning the conflicts and complexities inherent to the location of her own identity and its interaction with the world. Her clients include Painted Tree Pictures, Compartment S4, Hidden pockets collective and The Nomad Cafe.","The project attempts to underscore the importance of a space where questions, observations, opinions, unanswered anxieties on society through the lens of gender (that may often be in a liminal, nascent stage) have room to rest, breathe, be realised - reconciled. In an age of performative feminism, intellectual elitism, political correctness, woke and cancel culture, the exhibit demonstrates how the acknowledgement and normalisation of such a space and stage may help in the initiation of a more dialectic, deeper learning without fear of retribution. 

‘Bosslady’, confronts the loaded urban term ‘Bosslady ' and ‘Homemaker’ and its connotations. It questions the becoming and implications of both. It also seeks to question the kinds of labour capitalism sequesters into productive and non productive categories and its implications of human values of community and care.

‘Labour’ aims to make the labour of the then working class women that was responsible for the maintaining the lustre of spaces, its pristine, of beauty-making visible through a simple overlay of ‘behind the scene’ action that appears and vanishes with the click of a button.

‘Drop me home’ aims to bring out the exchanges between self identity and identification, understanding and expectations, honesty and performativity of feminism in proximity to each other to ask questions that may not have simple solutions or answers until systemic problems persist displacing onus on contending stakeholders.

‘How to raise a woke child’ aims to confront the conflicts between theory and practice of feminism in the midst of class expectations and primal parental instincts.","Krantinaari's work has dominantly been in the area of spreading awareness of our fundamental rights at the grassroot level for marginalised groups.

shafali+yatharth,"Ruthless assault on the self esteem of people in the name following gender norms or when they fail to fulfil the expectations of roles that have been defined for them is nonchalantly accepted.  Infact it is normalised that we don't even bat our eyes over it. There is now widespread consensus that gender, like race, is a social construct – meaning that it is an idea that was created through cultural and societal practices, rather than a reality constructed by nature. In many ways this idea of drawing boundaries and assigning dichotomies around objects and people is to blame for not able to accept the metaphor of gender with no clear delineations. There is a push to give a distinct name to every imagined position on this spectrum, though important we want to move beyond this taxonomic obsessions we have in regards to gender. While it is important for people to articulate their identity, it quickly turns tiresome and rather than embracing ambiguity and the potential for constant change. In our project we want to gaze into our obsession with gender through a library of collected objects, question our internalised biases and welcome the ideas of fluidity. The projects presents a list of curated objects to the audience and asks them to gender these object. This act of gendering brings our attention a lie called gender: with potentially deadly consequences for those manoeuvring outside or at the fringes of persistent and tightly circumscribed gender roles, as well as for many who fall well within the bounds of pre-defined femininity.",Initially we will curate a library of objects from people in terms of what they identify as a gender in terms of an object. This gives a unique and a nuanced way of looking at gender through a lens objects and explore myriads of possibilities. This collection could be done through various social media platforms or survey forms. The idea is to then use these objects and then present them in a form of digital narrative and ask the audience to categories them according to traditional genders based on some nonsensical pointers. This interaction would increasingly absurd and at the end the system could also gender you in turn based on the choices made. The digital space is used not only to curate the content but later in the experience becomes a mirror for society ad the role it plays while we interact with it.,"Graphic Elements/Assets/Design 10,000

As a new media designer, she wants to critically question the existing systems especially in terms of various matrices of oppression and look beyond the horizon.","The projects wants to question the notions of gender and the obsession we have towards labelling everything. We pick up these notions of gender from society and as Judith Butler calls it perform with such grace that we forget how much of us is actually just performance of gender. Performance is different from just being. We equate peoples value to them performing their gender. Our value is determined by what we do, how conforming we are to our prevailing gender norms. No matter what we do either we are asked to adjust or still come up short on expectations. We are all hurt by these rigid gender roles and through this project we want to question the traditional conceptualisations of gender. We intent on simply being and glory on our unique identities.

Nuhar Bansal,"This project is about finding out the extent of understanding, access to, & need for mental health related information in the community of middle-aged to older Punjabi women living in India. Being a young Punjabi woman myself, I have grown up seeing behaviors and expectations that, even though seemed normal then, seem horrendously damaging now. Impact of gendered roles on the mental well being of women is no secret. As per the 2017 National Mental Health Survey, 18% of Punjabis suffer from mental illness as against the national average of 13.6%. Further, as per a 2015 study conducted by Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, 86.7% of the middle aged women in Punjab suffered from Depression. The steep contrast of those numbers makes my heart sink for the Punjabi women. I have had the privilege to be a first generation mental health advocate in my family - which is why it is compelling for me to create work that speaks to the women of this specific demographic, but more importantly for the timeline & format of this specific project, to the children, friends, neighbors of these women who have access to information, vocabulary, awareness, & agency that most of these women themselves don't.

This project has the potential to be my life's study and work. As my first step in that direction, I want to create a digital mock up of a traditional women's magazine like Ghar Shringar, Grihshobha, Femina etc presenting the contents from a relatively feminist self care perspective. Fashion, Advice, Recipes, Make-up, Gossip, Erotica, Travel Destinations, Knitting Designs, Ads, are all very real relevant parts of the lives of women these magazines cater to. Which is why they are also the best way to reach them. If not for the pandemic, this would be a physical project with physical copies being distributed locally in Punjab. But then again, if not for the pandemic, I would not have been able to muster the courage of making this work for my community across the country, while sitting in Bangalore myself. These magazines have a massive following and a LOT of women turn to these as their source of information and entertainment - especially the ones who are not comfortable with technology or a language that is not Punjabi or Hindi. This magazine is being ideated as an open source project - I will be curating and editing the magazine - articles will be invited from public contributors from diverse and relevant backgrounds - on simple prompts such as '5 BEST PLACES FOR A SOLO TRIP FOR A 50 YEAR OLD', or, 'HOW TO TAKE SOME ME TIME EVERYDAY', or, '6 EASY RECIPES THAT YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW CAN MAKE' - basically simple ideas that challenge the little things. I plan to use the medium of inspired illustration and format of Ghar Shringar + Grihshobha to maintain the thread of relatability, familiarity & comfort. 

These real magazines went online - on web pages during the pandemic - basically alienating the said demographic. My vision is to make my project accessible as a downloadable pdf, or a stream of photos, or individual articles as text blobs or forwards that can be sent on whatsapp - which is the most widely used digital space by the concerned demographic. I plan to present this magazine in a larger digital flip book format as a conversation starter during the next phase of this work. ","As mentioned in the previous answer, the digital space that is relevant to the demographic that I am working with is quite limited. So I have split my approach in two parts - one part is about me being able to communicate with the said demographic - which will happen through whatsapp and telephonic exchange. Second part is me being able to communicate with everybody else who cares about this, who is more tech savvy - I will be engaging with them through an e-copy of the magazine, and some presentation led experiential take away exercises in digital meeting rooms - like Zoom, Whatsapp video call, telephone conference call, etc.

This project would not have been possible for me to even think of executing if not for the new found collaborative potential of the digital space in arts. ","Illustrators - 2 - 5000 x 2 = 10,000

Of the conscious choices I made, I believe in art being a very strong tool of expression and communication especially with a community that is alienated because of not having the language of mental health as we know it, because of barriers of age, cultural influences etc. I have always looked to work on projects that have a self aware, conscious streak of making space to provide agency to the community that doesn't have it.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s7ra_Q1FrrHxpGMywVOcD5DAMMFWaJne
Anurati Srivastva,"Malika-e-Marzi (Queen of my own Volition) – The Princess Can Save Herself is a platformer game akin to the popular game Mario that subverts the expected form of gameplay. In the original game, you would find that Mario moves across each level in his quest to save his princess. In this interactive digital game, the princess can save herself and is instead conquering her own fears, demons, trials and tribulations as the ruler and person with agency. The game follows the lives of real-life powerful queens and princesses that have ruled over the Indian subcontinent and narrates their stories of valour and rebellion. The stories and the research for the game will be drawn from sources such as Ira Mukhoty’s book ‘Daughters of the Sun: Empresses, Queens and Begums of the Mughal Empire’. Through interactive narratives, the game tells stories of women who were able to deviate from the archetype expected of women at the time under the Mughal empire, those who rode into battle with their men, built stunning monuments, engaged in diplomacy, traded with foreigners, minted coins in their own names, wrote biographies and patronised the arts. The game will be in mixed media, combining Mughal miniature artistic style with pixel based work, reminiscent of retro games.

The subverted game mechanism achieves dual purposes, one, to make the stories of braveheart women easily accessible and intriguing and bring these hidden stories to the forefront in a manner that is playful, interactive, and vaguely familiar to the audience. Two, the game spins the trope of the man rescuing the princess or the damsel in distress. In the new narrative, the princess saves herself, and many others while living an honest, courageous and fulfilling life. The game will have 5 levels that would tell the tales of 5 different queens and princesses. The user would be able to play the game like any platformer game, by pressing the up arrow key as the fortresses and ruins pass by. Unlike usual platformer games, this game would have an added layer of dialogue and text that would inform the user of the added achievement of the princess as it would appear in the chronological timelines of the ruler.  
","Interactive games and playable media forms are emerging as powerful media for digital artwork. Since the entire project is an interactive digital game, the user would be interacting with the artwork via their own agency as a player. The game mechanic is that of a familiar platformer game that would make it easy for any player to engage with online. The game would be hosted on a website that would be accessible by anyone with an internet connection.","Construct 3 License (software to build a game): 7513

Kris Chudawala,"An identity to create involves a journey taken of understanding it's formation. We read and know the definitions and the differences between words like gender identity, expression and roles, but what forms them at the level of an individual. The gender binary would have us believe that one is born as male or female, and we can identify as a man or woman. Beyond this binary and the shackles of redundant terms like masculinity and femininity, what really embodies our identity? This project aims to document the experience of non-conforming individuals who personify what we only theoretically understand as 'beyond the binary'.

A 35-year-old gym buff who prefers to rock high heels on most nights, a petite model who wanted to start tattooing as a side hustle when the pandemic hit to fund their therapy, a 25-year-old Dalit influencer who has built online platforms for persistent presence of resistance on social media, a trans community leader negotiating between daily livelihood and the wellfare of her young ones, what do they have in common amidst each other? Is it their emergent nonbinary identities, or the intention to break free of what society expects of them? What does gender itself mean to them? How do they reflect on the structures they live in, and why do they interact with the present the way they do? How do their memories translate into dreams? These questions are central to the exploration I intend to embark upon while trying to sculpt a narrative out of the answers presented through multiple formats of consumable media.

I intend to present our findings through multiple media instead of multimedia,  because of the sensory overwhelming nature of multimedia as an autistic artist. The central project would be a collaborative photo essay between the researcher, artist, and subject. The visual medium here artistically represents the findings of the project. This would be accompanied by multiple media layers of documentation of the research. We want each layer of the documentation and artwork to be accessible as stand-alone objects apart from them being a cumulative experience. We would ideally like to present the digital artworks in the form of a visual essay that links to the subject's own words which have led to the art. We would also like to capture the entire process of the project itself within an audio-visual format (film), as we believe that any form of representation cannot be complete, it is the sum of all that presents the complete picture including its biases and truths.
 
The cistematic gaze on trans people revolves around a generic identity which restricts the diversity of trans lives. We intend to pulverise this monolithic structure through honest portrayals which will dwell into examining the embodiment of gender concepts, it's meanings and its creation and roles in people's lives. Art, Resistance, the Self, Mental Health, Interpersonal Relationships, and Familial, Societal and Legal Structures, will be the key themes through which we would be attempting to challenge the said stereotypes which are being peddled via respectability politics.

Our primary process would be to interview non-conforming/nonbinary/trans individuals from various walks of life. Here an audio-visual interview where we also ask them to present us with memories (images, written narratives, sounds, etc) which in retrospect affirms their coming to terms with and understanding their identities and in the process also capture the intersections within trans* identifying individuals in India. The attempt here is to bring forward how the said individual defines the concept of gender for themselves and how they embody the same. The result of these interviews would be some form of a personal definition/concept of gender for the said participant which would then be used as the base theme to represent within a photograph of the subject. The whole project would itself be captured as a film as a reflection of the artistic process commenting on what we know as representation and artistic creation through lived experiences.
 I as a trans nonbinary individual myself would like to reflect through the investigations into these journeys of self-discovery. The idea is to truly build a narrative understanding of the process of coming out to oneself while dealing with the cistematic world around us. 
","The central product of this project is a photo-essay with a constellation of allied media. Using the digital space, we have the ability to therefore create an interactive experience for the audience using these medias.

Unlike what we understand as multimedia, this concept of multiple media allows every layer of the project findings and documentation to be stand alone art works and at the same time interact and create a nuanced experience adding tremendous value.

This project therefore would entirely be hosted on a digital platform as interactive art that on surface looks like a photo essay.

We also intend to capture the entire process as a film, which commentates on processes of art, hierarchy, agency, collaboration, and representation.","Majority of our funds will go towards the documentation process, artistic creation and paying the contributors.

Oishorjyo ,"A visual-aural landscape of desire and erotic narratives – stories, poems, essays that navigate intimacies and erotic encounters narrated through audio – visually overlain on mixed media imagery – choice of text, oil paintings (digitised and animated upon), alongwith a combination of photographs of intimate spaces/moments etc. such that the text and the images blend and smudge into each other, forming a complete sensory narrative. 

A total of 9 separate pieces will be presented – navigating the multiplicities of gender, telling tales of intimacies that have existed in its crevices – some lasting relationships, some fleeting anarchies of desire. The individual pieces of narration will be audio recorded and embedded on to the imagery itself – these will be stories of love and desire imagined as resistance to the popular tropes that exist in mainstream culture and navigate themes of genderqueer desire, collected and narrated from and by queer folks in India. 
As queer folks – one of the often missed nuances about our otherwise loud existences – is the tenderness that often blurs the lines between friendships, love and deep intimacies. These stories and essays will try to touch upon these very themes, drawing a larger context to the ideals of community, as we understand and invest in it – where our love and intimacies exist beyond heterosexual pre-conditionings, and often blur boundaries set rigidly by cis-het societies of relationships that are “allowed”.
Most of these stories, poems have been collected through intimate conversations with friends, while others in the last 3 years of researching and interviewing womenfolk who work with narratives of pleasure and erotica. Some examples I can share, would include: 
a)        story of a gay filmmaker in Bombay, who grew a deep intimacy with a male escort in Bombay, who would keep him company on lonely nights
b)        A newly married Dalit woman’s story of looking for places to have sex in, within a commune family system. 
c)        the story of a (cis)woman who learnt to incorporate Marathi galis in her bedroom dirty talk
d)        a fleeting romance between a muslim transwoman (let’s call her A) with a hindu non-binary, transperson (afab) (lets call them B) – where everything about their body that B dislikes is also what A desires – small wrists, wide hips, breasts et al. 
e)        A transwoman who starts to do sex work because it validates her body, the way she wants to be desired
f)        A genderqueer woman who comes to terms with her relationship with her own body while making video calls to a lover during a pandemic. 
g)        An author of erotica, where her sense of the erotics extends to her close friendships. 
h)        Poem – Making Love in a Washing Machine ; poet: Priyal
(goes without saying that all of these stories will only be shared only with consent of the original story bearers, and may or may not be presented anonymously depending upon the person’s comfort) 

The visual landscape will be a combination of erotic paintings (mostly oil on canvas) which will be digitised + animated upon, plus photographs collected from the story contributors of intimate spaces/moments. 
(attachment of sample paintings 
As an adjunct, there will also be an option with each story to share the same on social media – however this option will be integrated with a Haiku generator – which will all but take a few of the keywords from the story and automatically generate a haiku - urging the experiencer to reflect upon how intimacies shared on social media are but a bare minimal reflection of the depths the human heart is capable of. 
","For a large part of my twenties I have worked with digital media producing content and communication for newsrooms, elections, independent films, arts collectives and social enterprises. The decade of deep diving into digital allowed me to explore the binaries within which social media is often coded to function. This project will use digitality to challenge those very binary conditionings. 

While the visual and aural modalities will be analogous stories digitized, not in the typical AV modalities – but such that different parts of the visual landscape will allow the users to urge the story forward, creating an interactive experience, but also allowing for agency of the user to exercise choice of how much or little in the experience they want to partake in. On each interaction with the presentation, another layer of intimacy as exists within the story will be unlocked, allowing the experiencer to linger or leave as they choose. 
Secondly, a significant part of this that will exist without claiming much attention is the social media sharing option. As mentioned above, a Haiku generator will be integrated in this social media sharing button, which will take the length and breadth of the story and automate the generation of a haiku with some of the barebones keywords, hoping to urge the audience to reflect upon the flimsiness of our social media existences, and how what we see reflected in  these spaces is a mere watered down versions of the depths of human existence and thought.

","Oishorjyo: independent writer, transmedia artsworker
Oishorjyo is a Goa-based writer, performer and transmedia artsworker who usually works at the intersections of arts and media. She spent a decade working in new media strategy, conceptualising and producing media for newsrooms, independent films and research collectives. Their recent work as a part of the Lonely hearts Club explores themes of sexwork, submission and domination, building further on themes of their work as an IFA grantee last year, that explored the world of technology and sexwork, featuring indie pleasure artist Kali Sudhra. 
They have also written, performed and produced for stage and as a performer-theatremaker they work with multidisciplinary modalities, centering documentary narratives of women and queerfolk, around the themes of sexualness, digitality and social structures. In 2020, she founded an independent women's collective LooseWomenCollective, where women get together to process and share gendered experiences, and collaborate to create artworks around similar themes, with a focus to regional languages. Their writings have been published in The Independent, Firstpost, Smashboard, The Quint, Mongabay, The Better India, Herald, The Indian Economist among others.
","First and foremost the project is an attempt to share stories of intimacies, pleasure and desire as exist outside the normative ideals of “relationships” that are “allowed” by cis-het societies. In this, the project is an attempt to deconstruct the gendered lens through which we tend to process and label intimacies. Often among queerfolks the ideals of love, lust, romance, friendships, desires merge and blend into each other, obfuscating the temporalities of gendered relationships with both the Self and the Other. The stories exist in the crevices of how we perceive gender, and urge the audience to give up the conditioned gaze to be able to tap into the tenderness of intimacies that exist outside the scope of cis-het understandings of what desire looks like. 
","For a large part of the last decade I worked in digital spaces - designing communications and media for newsrooms, elections, independent films, arts collectives and social enterprises. The work allowed me to deep dive into the many contexts and biases of digital technology that only reiterated the binaries of the physical worlds we occupy. Over these last five years however, as I have moved from content production to storytelling in my own practices, I have also come into my own queernesses, having learnt to decondition myself rejecting the popular tropes. This process has gone through its own labyrinth exploring intimacies, sex and sexuality – most of which then has found place in my independent works – creative non-fiction essays, short stories and poems, monologues, audio stories etc. 
In the meantime, I started oil-paintings as mostly a therapeutic practice, practiced in the private. This was about 3 years ago, a time when I was also more investedly starting to research narratives of sex, sexuality and desire, beginning with my own. The paintings gradually started with embodying narratives that I could not find appropriate language or vocabulary for, and have most often been processing of desires and intimacies – many of them experienced first hand, some after long intimate conversations with friends. Inevitably my paintings, usually have an erotic theme to them, and are explorations of intimate relationships – some with the body and self, some engaging with the idea of the Other. Since in my own intimacies the idea of the Other is not a gendered manifestation, most paintings reflect a certain genderqueerness in its visual representation. Inevitably, since most of these explorations – both in terms of the stories collected, as well as the act of translating them onto the canvas, have been so tender I have so far rarely presented them on any public platform. Earlier this year, a couple of them were for the first presented as a part of a group show in at ISCP New York, curated by the AfterParty Collective. Thereafter, this is the first time I’m attempting to blend and present my explorations of oil paints, with the stories of genderqueer desire – blending personal practices, perhaps finally ready to let folks in into what has so far been private explorations of tenderness.

Ishita Shah,"The Dirty Archive

This curatorial collaboration is about the archives which “should not have existed” in the first place; but now they do and you don’t know what to do with it. Neither can you throw them away, nor can you show them. These are experiences which even your closest friend or your friend-like grandfather might not know about. A proposal to a school senior on the radio, sext communications with your college professor, apology letter you wrote to your mother but never gave it, pictures of cross dressing attempts when you got your own place or voices notes from an extra marital affair, curious conversations about your body with Google, visits to a therapist for mental wellbeing or picture cut outs of your favorite porn star; these archives could be of any form but they are definitely very intimate.
 
Experiences which have formed a part of you: but because social taboos wouldn’t allow you to express these emotions publicly, they “must” be kept hidden. The mere act of hiding such memories and protecting them from the eyes of our own people creates tension in our identities about ourselves. In reality these experiences might have led us to knowing ourselves. 

This project intends to connect with community members of different age groups, who would like to preserve and showcase their most intimate experiences from their personal pasts. Collectively, we would probe into questions of archiving the self, invite experts to workshop with us, and eventually develop an interactive platform, the Dirty Archive, which will be curated with pride and no regrets. Such an archive will question various societal prejudices and the behaviors of shaming others. But at the forefront, it will be a celebration of our intimate experiences! In its most fundamental form, this archive and its collections will show how similar we all are yet so unique as beings, when it comes to exploring our identities: be it religious, sexual, professional, caste-based or any other. The logic of this interaction will be rooted in anonymity of participation, freedom of linguistic expression and offering a safe space to share, comment and engage in various ways with the curatorial. 
Over a period of three weeks, intensive digital workshops will be conducted weekly with community members from all walks of life. If time and situations allow, we would also like to hold one workshop in-person to ensure inclusivity of members who might be tech savvy. These workshops will be facilitated such that participants can dive deep into their ‘dirty archives’, identify at least one object worth preserving and showcasing, describing its metadata as well as reflecting on its ‘dirtiness’. The stories about why these archival items have been locked away somewhere and the ink has faded, are very important to the curatorial exploration. Every group will also look at the mini collection and discuss the possibilities of co-curating the main exhibit. 

Simultaneously, an open anonymous submission platform will also be created for those who can’t join the workshops, but would like to archive their memory or experience. Guidelines will be in place, which works across different modes of submission and engagement with this project idea. Eventually the curatorial team will be working on creating a framework for developing the exhibit on digital platform and ensuring high level of interactivity across archival assets.  Curatorial team will thus consist of a mixed media artist, web developer, visual designer along with the curator and workshop leads.  

The exhibit will also collect responses in playful ways to understand the sociological and psychological effects of such a project. Commenting will be allowed only after moderation, so that we can keep the dialogue going until the subscription for the web platform is sustainable. This prototype will also be a stepping stone for developing more focused versions of this project in the future – wherein the dirty archive can help bring out stories and experiences of women from marginalized communities, daily wage earners, restaurant servers, youngest of the adults and so on. ","The duration of this prototype exercise requires us to connect with known or related audiences, who would understand the basic premise of this project. Thus, the digital space will easily allow us to connect/ communicate with such participants and community members from across borders, whether it is for the workshop participation or direct submissions via the preset forms. Spreading the word will be much easier! Even participation will be simpler for interested members since it will not involve physical travel or any other logistical resources. 

However, the digital interaction doesn’t easily allow for trust building and feeling the comfort of sharing intimate experiences. The curatorial will constantly build in icebreaking exercises, provide scaffolding to participants as and when they would require, and resolve inquiries in one-on-one communication. We will also like to rope in workshop facilitators as well as other team members of the curatorial team from across different locations. The digital space will also make this arrangement much easier in the current scenario. 

Lastly, the digital space is important for exploring and experimenting with the idea of exhibiting the dirty archive. It will allow for different iterations of curation, as well as work with different community members before finalizing the form of the output. This dialogical possibility which the digital space provides will extend the life of the project beyond this festival. ","Meeting Platform subscription for 2 months – 3000

I am currently pursuing research on architectural history of 20th Century India through the perspective of women practitioners as a Graham Foundation Grantee 2020; and exploring subversive frameworks for community archiving projects through Futura Tropica Fellowship 2020.","The curatorial doesn’t mean to limit the understanding of ‘dirty archives’ to only what might be gender and sexuality driven experiences; however, it is also undeniably one of the most prominent themes of hidden personal pasts. Even when we have heard stories about a child feeling insecure about another child in the household, gender plays a pivotal role in the interpretation of that experience. Similarly, so many acts of societal shaming have been primarily based on the conventional reading of the gender of the person(s). Such instances would say a lot about the deep rootedness of gender biases in our sociocultural environments, which leads to hiding of one’s memories. The curatorial thus imagines that when such a safe space is offered, the participants’ contributions will highlight the gender-based issues from across different contexts of the society. This exposition will not only be limited to how others perceive the gender of the participant(s)-in-discussion, but also allow the conversations about self-exploration of gender find a meaningful platform for uninhibited display and critical discourse. 

Furthermore, themes like gender which will emerge from the reading and interpretation of the dirty archives, will engage the archive-making process into questions of identity and representation. How does the institutional or colonial archive address concerns of intersectionality? Is there room for anonymity when one is engaged in self-archiving project(s)? How would such an archive be read and deciphered by a wide-range of audiences who may or may not relate with gender diversities? ","I have been working with archiving and creative interpretation for over a decade now, both in pedagogical formats as well as a way to engage with different kinds of historical spaces. Last year the pandemic led me to work with archiving as a way to build communities and develop critical discourses around cultural matters. First, I conducted 10 to 15 days long workshops on family archiving, and later we developed a one-of-its-kind incubation program on Constructing Personal Archives. During this four-month long virtual interaction, we engaged with participants from across five countries and several cities in India to co-curate their archiving projects, be it about a deceased family member, or a forgotten activist relative, or life and works of their former employer and so on.  Again, the format included intensive workshops, one-on-one discussions and a series of open dialogues based on four thematic area at Curating for Culture (a personal collective).

Two themes which are relevant to this project proposal would be: South Asia/India in the Archives and Empowering the Local. It is very important to my practice that we understand as a living community, what it means to archive? It was not a part of our cultural milieu but with every passing day it is becoming very important to employ the practices of archiving creatively and re/write our own histories before so much is erased or forgotten or lost to time.

Muskaan,"Designing digital spaces for women 

Living in the digital age and in the twenty-first century, where practically everyone is equipped with a digital device, I was surprised to learn that a digital divide still persists, particularly in India. In India's eight states and two union territories, less than 40% of women have used the internet compared to men, according to data.
As I dug deeper into the research, I discovered that one of the continuous themes of why the digital divide exists is a lack of digital literacy in women's usage of technology. Women were 1.6 times more likely than men to report a lack of skills as a barrier to internet use. The most prevalent societal issues, such as the inability to use public ICT, digital access, and women's lack of financial freedom to purchase digital technology, all contribute to the current level of digital literacy. Equipping women and girls with digital skills helps put them on equal footing with digitally savvy men and open up countless opportunities for increased agency and choice. Examples of doing this include creating Websites and mobile applications on health and legal rights, for example, that can help women make informed decisions to safeguard and care for themselves and their families, while online social networks and digital communications allow women to disseminate information and share knowledge beyond their immediate community.

The aim of the project is to create more digital inclusivity for middle-aged urban women for them to be able to trust themselves and be a part of the digital revolution. The vision is to close or lessen the digital gender gap and the generational gap by making middle-aged women digitally inclusive while building the argument that access is not empowerment. 
I further carried out intense secondary research which focused on looking into the roots of the problem, by looking at it from a historical, social, and cultural perspective. This was further augmented via primary research tools such as user interviews, observation enquiry, ecology mapping, affinity mapping and user journey. The four main reasons why the users were developing digital literacy and skills issues were fear of technology, lack of self-reliance, lack of digital education and an increased digital dependency.

I, through the project, aim to bridge the gap between technology and women by creating a safe digital learning platform specifically focused on them which helps in developing self-reliance, building trust with the technology, reducing cognitive load while using it and makes them feel more digitally inclusive by eliminating fear.

Initially named Digimom, the application focuses on creating an easy learning platform for the urban middle-aged women to get together and feel a part of the space specifically focused on them.

About:  It is a mobile-based platform created to help mothers and women to establish their own identities and learn digital skills to improve their trust in digital media.

Users:  primary target audience: homemakers mothers women
            Secondary target audience: working mothers + homemakers 

Purpose: To promote digital inclusion and self-reliance amongst middle-aged users dealing with low digital literacy.

Key features of the application: 

Community building: building a free online space where they can open up, see other mothers and their stories, share ideas freely of job options, recipes, ideas etc anything

Simplified experience: An easy and accessible UI experience that they can easily understand and to increase the usability of the application. a digital guided experience Includes a planner to keep them in check carrying digital facts and learning that is assisted with primary stakeholders making videos

Digital learning: Bringing an array of tutorials and podcasts to the user on maintaining their privacy,their finances , being secure on digital spaces etc to help them be self reliant and use the digital spaces safer and better

It focuses using the metaphor of mother and cares taking (here the app takes care of them) in turn building up (digital) spaces such as a community for connectivity and faster learning
",The project’s fundamental premise is for urban middle-aged women to get access to digitally empowering arrays and self-teaching their way through this while existing in their everyday life. The digital nature of the application creates room for conducting the pilot testing of the application through digital mediums. The user feedback loops I intend to develop would exist without the need for any physical interaction and the application’s interface would also be the primary point of interaction between the artist and the user group.,"A.

Still discovering the world of art and design, she is. especially interested in collaborative work processes that deal with issues of gender identity, safety, and inclusivity
","Since Digimom, is a space particularly designed for a specific group of women that are often left out of the digital and technological era because of the gender gap and generational gap, my project directly questions the digital inclusivity of a very important target audience of the middle-aged urban women especially mothers who have not been given many chances to be represented within the digital spaces who still feel alien sometimes using the digital devices itself and have little or too much digital dependency. Even though the project aims to focus on one specific gender that identifies as women, there are still many prospects to focus on and discuss issues about the other genders who have been digitally excluded in the project's future.
It raises an important question for the entire digital age to investigate and represent more women online, as well as provide an opportunity for them to feel a part of this evolution, as they have been left out of the conversation for a long time.

Riddha,"The proposed digital performance is a collaboration between two performance artists, a sound artist, a visual artist, and a filmmaker. We are attempting to make a lyrical documentary performance imagined as a love letter written by one of the performers (Riddha, she/her) to the other (Tupi, they/them). Earlier in 2021, Tupi, though assigned male at birth, began identifying as non-binary and discarded their previous name and pronouns in some aspects of their personal life (they aren’t fully “out” yet). Riddha and Tupi met when the latter was still using their former pronouns and their deadname in all aspects of their life. Sharing an interest in theatre, the two grew close in the process of working on multiple stage productions with each other. The proposed performance is an attempt by Riddha to archive this period in Tupi’s life where they attempt to navigate the effects of transitioning to an identity they feel more comfortable with while trying to deal with the remnants of their old self. It is her way of showing them what she sees when they (Tupi) dance, comb their hair, or articulate themselves with heartbreaking caution.
The primary aim of this project is to present a depiction of the private aspects of transitioning, and the struggle to break away from a lifetime spent living under labels that failed to define the true nature of the person they were applied to. Even though one may choose a new identity for themself and feel comfortable in it, coming to terms with it and fully accepting said identity is a related, but ultimately separate, challenge which poses a unique set of issues for the person to deal with. The performers themselves hope to use this process as a form of creative therapy and incorporate the new identity chosen by one of them into the long-standing dynamic that the two have shared ever since they did their first production together in 2015.","The performance is conceptualised for the platform Zoom and will contain both a recorded and a live element. In the former we are going to test the limits of the digital image to capture affect, both in terms of visual and sound composition. As for the nature of images, we will experiment with a grammar of repetition and juxtapositions as a way of capturing Tupi’s ongoing experience with the realities of transitioning and the impact it has had on their everyday existence, revolving around routine actions and gestures such as the combing of hair, the application of mascara, the shaving of facial and body hair, etc. This will be combined with documentary photographs and footage gathered from the various theatre exercises Riddha will do with Tupi to create a safe space of self expression for them. Riddha’s will also be the performative gaze behind the camera. The live element of the performance will involve the spectators interacting with the character undergoing transition, assisting the latter with certain aspects of their daily routine. From time to time they will be asked to switch on their cameras and engage with Tupi, to achieve the sense of a community however virtual and transient.","Camera and Lens (Rent 5 days) - 20,000

He is currently freelancing as a music producer and collaborating with theatre practitioners and filmmakers in an attempt to create sonic narratives.
Riddha is a theatre and performance studies research scholar in JNU. She is currently drafting her Mphil proposal which will focus on actor training pedagogies and digital theatre. She is also acting in an independent experimental film, and was actively involved in collegiate theatre and Practice as Research in the past.
Avali is an independent research scholar as  well as a visual artist with primary interest in contemporary South Asian art practices, bookmaking, and miniature painting traditions. She completed her MA in the School of Arts and Aesthetics, JNU in 2020.
Jaheen, Dhaka-based writer-filmmaker, has been experimenting with filmmaking and screenwriting since his undergrad years. He published poems and fiction in his teenage years. Later, with the urge to translate his literary works into the language of visual storytelling, Jaheen enrolled in the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh to study Media and Filmmaking. Currently, he is pursuing an MA in Arts and Aesthetics from JNU.
Tupi is a graduate of the MA History program at SOAS, London University. An amateur theater performer, they have been involved in working in the collegiate theatre space since 2015.","The project is founded upon the changing gender identity of one of the performers involved in it and takes inspiration from their lived experience. The decision to change the labels that define their gender identity stemmed from years of introspection and soul-searching regarding who they were and how they could feel comfortable within their own body. And yet, the final decision to switch away from a masculine to a non-binary identity was not followed by any changes in their daily life, apart from the multiple conversations they had to have about their new identity with close friends they chose to trust with this information. There was no accompanying increase in self-worth or lessening of mental torment regarding their identity. The unfamiliarity with the self that existed before the decision to transition continued.
This posed a whole new challenge. How do they get themself to accept the identity that they have chosen for themself? Gut instinct tells them that the answer to it lies within their daily routine and the weaning away of the perceived hints of “masculinity” from their everyday actions. That is the theme this performance seeks to address. It takes a look at the transitioning process, which is contained within the mundane activities of the non-binary person through the eyes of a cisgender person who has been in a close relationship with the former since before they started questioning their identity.","Aside from their independent ventures as a musician and theatre practitioner respectively, Vinayak and Riddha have collaborated on various digital Performance as Research projects during her time in the School of Arts and Aesthetics, JNU. They share an interest in the phenomenology of their mediums as well as agential potentialities of the performer in subverting classical tradition and the codification of the body. Their recent work is particularly inspired by the instinct to create heavily sensorial images that create meaning in the extreme affects they invoke, as a way of rejecting the duality between mind and body.
Avali has delved in the act of self-caricaturization by portraying herself as the other ‘Other’ in her portrait series. Using self as an icon or a subject, she creates self-portraits to curb the anxiety of not belonging, or feeling defamiliar with its given body.
In Dhaka, Jaheen produced installation-based video arts, experimental short films, documentaries, etc such as Castle by the Shore, S/he Protects and Antiestablishment?. Then, he started working as a screenwriter-filmmaker film & advertising production company Facecard Productions. His debut film Nonexistence Mon Amour won numerous national and international acclamations.
Tupi has been involved in working with themes of gender and mental health through various projects including but not limited to, a photoshoot revolving around defying gender stereotypes with Itisaras, an independent sketch and subsequent music video for the band SabCulture on themes of depression, and a starring role in a yet to be released independent film.
