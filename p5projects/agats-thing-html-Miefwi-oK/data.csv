line1,line2
I FEEL BAD,ABOUT
WHAT I SAID,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
I MEANT WHAT I SAID,
BUT NOT,IN THE WAY
,YOU HEARD IT
I THOUGHT I WAS CLEAR,
YOU ASKED ME,WHAT I FELT
AND I TOLD YOU,
EXACTLY,
HOW I FEEL,BUT
THEN,YOU THOUGHT
THAT I WAS,NOT REALLY SAYING
WHAT I FELT. ,AND
YOU ASKED ME,TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT I HAD,
JUST SAID. ,SO
I CORRECTED MYSELF,
NOT BECAUSE,I WANTED TO
BUT,
ONLY BECAUSE,I FELT
THAT YOU WOULD,UNDERSTAND ME
BETTER THAT WAY,
